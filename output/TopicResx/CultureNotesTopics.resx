    <value>Offering Criticism</value>
</data>
<data name="COMn1Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In most parts of the world, a society's culture dictates the appropriate ways to express criticism toward others. Understanding what forms of criticism are acceptable in a given culture can be extremely valuable in maintaining mutual respect in business relationships. &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;East Asia&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;Many East Asian cultures--including those of China, Korea, and Japan--are based on the idea that one of society's key foundations is proper, courteous human relationships. In these cultures, direct criticism is considered arrogant and insulting, especially if it is done in public. If you need to give negative feedback, you should do it in private and with a minimum of emotion. This will help reduce the embarrassment for both you and the other person.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;There are some differences, however, among Asian cultures. In Korea, for example, it is not uncommon for superiors to loudly criticize junior staff members, but they will rarely do so in front of an outsider. In Japan and Korea, employees will publicly assume responsibility, or criticize themselves publicly, if they make a mistake. In Thailand and Singapore, people rarely criticize one another. When they do, the discussion is private and very polite. In fact, criticism is often given with a smile, in an attempt to make the criticism seem less direct and less negative. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;United States&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;In the United States, particularly in the business world, there is a high value placed on assertive behavior, and criticism in the workplace is not uncommon. Embarrassing people is not the goal, however, so many people try to offer constructive suggestions for improvement rather than simply giving negative criticism. When giving criticism, people may soften their language a bit by using certain expressions. "This is difficult for me to say, but..." or " or "On the one hand, you did this well, but on the other hand, you need to work on ..." are good ways to introduce a point without being too negative. In addition, many companies have formal evaluation processes in place. Once or twice a year, an employee and supervisor meet to discuss job performance. This method of communicating provides a structured way to discuss all aspects of an employee's contributions to the company.</value>

    <value>Differences of Opinion</value>
</data>
<data name="COMn2Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It is easy to understand the way a culture approaches disagreements by looking at the communication styles in that culture. In societies where open discussion is encouraged, conflict is much more common and accepted. On the other hand, cultures that strive to reduce negativity and maintain harmony do not see such interaction as appropriate, particularly in the workplace. &lt;P&gt;In &lt;B&gt;Australia&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;B&gt;Great Britain&lt;/B&gt;, and the &lt;B&gt;United States&lt;/B&gt;, for example, disagreements are considered a natural part of communication. People in these countries typically have open and honest discussions, even if people's differences of opinion lead to confrontation. In a business setting, this may mean debating with a colleague or a supervisor over the approach to a task. Or, co-workers might have a discussion about the relevance of an agenda item during a meeting. Conflict is not necessarily negative, though, and many people feel that debating an issue is as rewarding as resolving it. Successful conflict resolution is also seen as a valuable skill, and most people at the management level are expected to be very good at handling conflicts that arise in the workplace.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The Asian style of communication is quite different. In most parts of &lt;B&gt;eastern Asia&lt;/B&gt;, individuals present their ideas and then wait for others to do the same. They prefer to seek agreement from a group without rejecting another's opinions out loud. In business meetings, subordinates will rarely disagree openly with their supervisor. This shows respect for the supervisor, and it reflects the cultural importance placed on politeness and building harmony and trust.</value>

    <value>Do your clothes make a &lt;I&gt;personal&lt;/I&gt; statement? Or do they convey a &lt;I&gt;group&lt;/I&gt; identity? To most Westerners, clothing is a way to communicate something about who they are. Uniforms, however, are common in most parts of Asia and signify the importance of conformity in the workplace. When you travel to different parts of the world, be aware of the fashion rules for the workplace so you can choose your wardrobe accordingly. &lt;p&gt; &lt;B&gt;Japan and Korea&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;White-collar male employees in Japan and Korea wear dark suits and ties with white shirts. Female employees usually wear a uniform dress. Blue-collar executives and laborers typically wear the same uniform to encourage harmony and reduce division among the ranks. &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Europe&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;On the other hand, people in France and other European countries place a high value on individuality in fashion and take pride in their wardrobe choices. Instead of creating a unified work environment, a strict dress code would likely cause anger and resentment among employees. &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;United States&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;In the United States, workplace clothes vary a great deal. While uniforms are somewhat common in blue-collar jobs--assembly lines, service industries, and so on--the majority of the white-collar work force dress according to their own tastes. Often, the specific business situation dictates what clothing is appropriate. Employees who have frequent formal meetings or interaction with the public are more likely to dress up. However, in companies where the focus is on product development or research, employees are usually more concerned with comfort than with appearance. In addition, there has been a trend in recent years in many American companies toward more casual dress. Some companies also have specified dress-down days, when it is acceptable for everyone to wear casual clothing.</value>

    <value>Mergers and Acquisitions</value>
</data>
<data name="BizAn2Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Mergers and acquisitions have been increasing worldwide throughout the 1990s. The total value of transactions in the United States in each of the last three years was more than US $500 billion. In emerging markets in 1997, there were 119 transactions that were valued at US $50 million, representing a 50% increase over 1996 in the number of deals. Europe has also experienced a dramatic rise in mergers and acquisitions, and more are expected as a result of the formation of the European Monetary Union in 1999. In 1997, one-third of all mergers and acquisitions worldwide were international in nature, with companies from developed countries accounting for the majority of acquirers (86%).&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Three key forces have been linked to the increased pace of mergers and acquisitions in the 1990s: rising stock markets, industry deregulation, and industry globalization. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rising Stock Markets. &lt;/B&gt;Dramatic increases in share prices fuel mergers and acquisitions. The steep rise in the value of European and U.S. stock markets has made it attractive for companies to use their stock as payment when entering into a merger or purchasing another company.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Deregulation&lt;/B&gt; has also been a key reason for the increase in merger and acquisition activity. Many governments in emerging markets have relaxed their ownership restrictions in certain industries such as airlines, healthcare, telecommunications, energy, utilities and banks. As a result, companies are able to sell off strategic assets to the highest bidder, even if the highest bidder is a foreigner. In addition, deregulation in developed countries has increased the level of competition in many of those same industries. Therefore, in order to improve their competitive position, many companies are realigning their businesses through mergers and acquisitions, with many of those transactions occurring on a worldwide basis.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Globalization&lt;/B&gt; is another driving force for the mergers of the 1990s. Companies are now seeking to form strategic alliances, where similar businesses combine to strengthen their global presence. Often, technology and patents fuel the mergers, as seen in telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, and financial services. Business is now truly global in nature, and companies must expand to meet the demands of their customers around the world.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

    <value>Contracts</value>
</data>
<data name="BizAn1Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In Europe, the United States, and many countries around the world, written contracts are an important part of doing business. A contract is a binding agreement that outlines the responsibilities of each party involved in the agreement. It also specifies the length of time that the contract will be in force. Changing the terms of a contract usually requires a written amendment to the original contract to be accepted by all parties.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Although written contracts are common around the world, the history and traditions related to contracts vary. When doing business in another country, it can be helpful to understand the philosophy regarding contracts in that culture, including when and how they're used and whether traditional beliefs affect current practices. Three countries where tradition comes into play are Japan, China, and Korea.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Japan&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;Traditionally, Japanese businesspeople have felt that a verbal agreement is sufficient and that trust is the key to determining the success of a business relationship. This is still true to a large extent in small, non-global businesses. Multinational corporations in Japan, however, are familiar with European and American business practices, and they are accustomed to dealing with written contracts. Still, because of the cultural and philosophical differences that surround this issue, there is a chance of offending a Japanese businessperson by focusing on a written contract too early in the process of working together. Even if a contract is the agreed-upon goal of both parties, building trust and respect in the relationship first can help the negotiations proceed more smoothly.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;China&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;In China, written contracts are common, but the traditional belief is that the primary purpose of a contract is to establish a positive relationship between the companies involved. Businesspeople tend to write contracts that cover broad principles rather than specific issues. Details are often dealt with verbally. This way, the details of a contract can change as the interests of the companies involved change.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Korea&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;In South Korea, as in other parts of Asia, building relationships is an important part of doing business. In fact, there is a South Korean proverb that says, "Make a friend first and a client second." Although written contracts are common in business dealings, Korean businesspeople tend to believe that written contracts merely summarize an agreement between parties and can be adjusted as circumstances change. It's considered common sense to understand that no one can predict the future and that being willing to re-negotiate contracts is in everyone's best interest.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

    <value>Interruptions</value>
</data>
<data name="COMn3Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The tolerance for interruptions during a conversation, formal meeting, or a presentation depends on the culture of a given society. In some cultures, it is not appropriate to interrupt, whereas other cultures expect--and even encourage--it. Understanding and respecting the cultural differences can be a step toward more successful communication among global colleagues. &lt;P&gt;Two terms that help define how interruptions are viewed in different cultures are &lt;I&gt;high involvement&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;high considerateness&lt;/I&gt;. People in high involvement cultures think it's important for everyone to share ideas and give opinions, so there often isn't much emphasis placed on conversation etiquette. Some cultures noted for this style include Russian, Italian, Greek, South American, Arab, Israeli, African, Australian, and North American. Generally speaking, you can expect people from these areas to:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;talk more&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;interrupt and expect to be interrupted more&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;avoid silence&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;talk somewhat loudly&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;talk quickly &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;High considerateness describes a style where listening to others is more highly valued than giving one's own opinion. It is appropriate to give your opinion if you're asked to do so, but you will typically be expected to wait until the current speaker has finished speaking. Many Asian cultures are noted for this style. In general, you can expect people from these areas to:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;speak one at a time&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;use polite sounds to indicate that they are listening&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;appreciate silence&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;avoid interrupting &lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;talk somewhat softly&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;talk slowly&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</value>

    <value>Saving Face</value>
</data>
<data name="COMn4Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Saving face, or the act of preserving one's outward dignity or honor, is present in all cultures. No one likes to be embarrassed, or lose face, so people try to present themselves in the best possible way. In some societies, however, the importance of saving face is evident in nearly every interaction, including those in the workplace. This is most true in cultures where collectivism--focus on the group--dictates what is appropriate behavior and what is not. One's status within a group is determined by the level of respect one has earned, so it's important to maintain that respect. Losing face results in some degree of exclusion from the group and a lowering of status. &lt;P&gt;High face-saving cultures include &lt;B&gt;Asian&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;Arab&lt;/B&gt; cultures and, to a lesser extent, those in &lt;B&gt;Latin America&lt;/B&gt;. There are many ways to save face when interacting with others. Some common behaviors are:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;being vague when asked to express an opinion&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;telling small untruths to avoid embarrassment&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;remaining silent&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;being indirect to avoid saying &lt;I&gt;no&lt;/I&gt; to someone.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;All of these methods minimize the possibility of saying something that might offend someone. Communicating this way also shows a great deal respect for the opinions of others. People in these cultures choose their words very carefully because they know that whatever they say will be listened to carefully and taken very seriously. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In many parts of &lt;B&gt;Europe&lt;/B&gt; and the &lt;B&gt;United States&lt;/B&gt;, society is more focused on the individual than on the group. Because of this, businesspeople are less concerned about face-saving issues. This means that their discussions can be argumentative, they ask questions, and they feel comfortable stating their opinions. Their first consideration is straightforward communication. This doesn't mean that there is no concern for the feelings of others, but sharing information takes priority. If someone does say something embarrassing, apologizing for the mistake is usually all that's expected, and most people forget the incident soon after it happens.</value>

</data>
<data name="COMn5Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Is it always good to praise someone for a job well done, a new tie or an attractive blouse? Not necessarily. It depends on the country, the status between the giver and receiver, and the gender of the people involved.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;People in the United States are used to giving and receiving compliments. In many situations, complimenting someone can be a way of initiating conversation. It's acceptable to compliment an individual's presentation or participation in a meeting, and praising food preparation or someone's material possessions is considered polite. Around the globe, however, too much complimenting can be interpreted as insincere.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In most Asian countries, it is impolite to isolate an individual's performance, so most compliments will be refused. In addition, it's best to avoid complimenting a supervisor. That may be seen as a way to gain favor. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When working or traveling in the Middle East, be particularly careful about complimenting someone's possessions. The person may feel obligated to present them to you as a gift.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In the United States, you can get into trouble by commenting on a woman's appearance. Even though you may have good intentions, your compliments could be interpreted as a form of sexual harassment, which is illegal. In the Middle East, complimenting a women is considered sinful and brings dishonor to the woman's family. This is quite different from Latin America and southern Europe, where polite notice of a woman's appearance is common. &lt;/P&gt;</value>

<data name="COMn6Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Unconsciously, we all keep a certain distance around us when interacting with others. The size of this distance--or personal space--depends on the culture and the nature of the relationship. &lt;P&gt;For people in the United States, the usual distance in social conversation is about an arm's length. Since a smaller distance may imply greater intimacy or aggressive behavior, it is common for Americans to say "Excuse me" for even the slightest accidental touching of another person. Latin Americans and Arabs, on the other hand, prefer to stand close together during conversations. Maintaining a greater distance may be considered cold or impolite. Asian cultures are mostly non-touching cultures, and even family members or very close friends rarely hug or kiss in public. Japanese colleagues usually stand about two arms' length apart, while Koreans and Chinese are comfortable with slightly less than that. It's common, however, for this distance to decrease at a social event outside of the office.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In the United States, personal space reflects a need for privacy. Americans generally prefer quite a bit of space, and they often like to have access to a separate room or other area that is set aside just for them. Ironically, both Eastern (non-contact) societies and Middle Eastern (contact) cultures have a high tolerance for crowding. The space available to employees at work is often shared with many other people. In fact, the word &lt;I&gt;privacy&lt;/I&gt; doesn't exist in either Arabic or Japanese.</value>

    <value>Accounting</value>
</data>
<data name="FINn1Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Like a country's laws, its accounting standards usually reflect its national culture, ideals, and politics. The relationship between people who produce accounting statements and people who use them also influences the standards in a given country. &lt;P&gt;There are four basic accounting models that are used around the world today: Anglo American, Continental, South American, and Mixed Economy. In recent years, a fifth model that tries to unify the other models into a single global perspective has also begun to develop.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Anglo-American model. &lt;/B&gt;This accounting model focuses on the information needs of the investors and creditors. The stock markets in countries that follow this model are usually large and well developed, and companies rely heavily on securities to raise the capital they need to do business. Under this model, the accounting practices for multinational corporations are quite sophisticated. This model is common in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Mexico, and South Africa.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Continental model. &lt;/B&gt;The main characteristic of the countries that use this model is the close relationship between business and the banks and governments of those countries. Accounting practices are legalistic and conservative, and the emphasis is more on government policies than investor decision-making needs. Countries that operate under this model include Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and Japan.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;South American model. &lt;/B&gt;This accounting model developed in response to high inflation in many countries. It also reflects significant government control over business accounting practices because it is geared mostly toward the reporting of taxable income. As such, accounting guidelines are strict so the governments ensure that businesses pay the tax for which they are responsible. Most countries in South America subscribe to this model, including Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Mixed Economy model. &lt;/B&gt;This accounting model is a result of the political and economic changes in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In order to respond to the remnants of central government planning and control as well as market-oriented pressure, many businesses maintain two types of records. The first, which tracks information that is essential in a tightly controlled economy, is designed for company managers and focuses on production and employment budgets rather than financial results. The second set of records is intended for investors and creditors, and it provides information similar to that provided by the Anglo-American model. Countries that follow this model include Russia, Poland, Hungary, and Romania.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;International Standards. &lt;/B&gt;In an effort to harmonize the various--and sometimes contradictory--accounting models around the world, many multinational corporations are working toward a new model that standardizes and streamlines certain accounting practices on a global level. This model makes the most sense for companies that raise capital in foreign markets because it allows them to follow one method of reporting, regardless of the source of their operating income and capital funding. One body that currently sets international standards followed by many corporations is the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). These standards take into account changes in prices or foreign currency, investments in subsidiaries, and so on, making it easier for multinational corporations to accurately represent their information. However, corporations are still required to follow their local country standards, even if they use the international standards as well.</value>

<data name="FINn2Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Investors invest their funds both domestically and internationally to diversify their holdings and to take advantage of high potential returns in other countries. However, there are several factors that affect the ability and desire of an individual investor to tap into particular foreign markets: investment restrictions; information barriers (language, disclosure, accounting); and high taxes and transaction costs. These obstacles tend to be most common in emerging markets, such as Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Restrictions. &lt;/B&gt;Many countries impose restrictions on the flow of money into and out of the country and on investments in industries that are of significant importance to the nation. These restrictions can decrease the efficiency of a country's capital markets, and they make it difficult for investors to determine the true value of a country's investment opportunities. This results in decreased potential returns for investors. One example is Malaysia, which introduced controls in the fall of 1998 that prohibit investors from taking the proceeds of the sale of their investments out of the country for at least 12 months. This restriction limits an investor's options once he has invested in Malaysia and therefore potentially limits returns as well.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Information barriers&lt;/B&gt;. Investment decisions are often dependent on the flow of information. The less information there is for an investor, the more difficult investing can be. For example, analyzing investment opportunities in Continental Europe and South America is often quite challenging because of the many different languages and accounting standards that exist in those regions. If individual investors cannot get access to quick, reliable information, they may decide not to invest in those markets.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Costs. &lt;/B&gt;Taxes and high transaction costs also limit an individual investor's access to some markets. For example, investors in Japanese equities are penalized high fees for transactions that involve a small number of shares. In addition, many countries impose a withholding tax on all income taken out of a country by a foreign investor. Taxes and transaction costs can make those markets less attractive for small investors.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P ALIGN="CENTER"&gt;* * *&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Despite significant obstacles, the number and value of cross-border investments has increased dramatically in recent years, due in part to the high rates of growth in emerging markets. In order to reduce the risks and avoid some of the complications of making foreign investments, individuals often rely on professionals and investing institutions to make their investment decisions for them. For example, individuals can purchase shares of mutual funds that focus on particular overseas markets, such as an emerging market mutual fund.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

    <value>Executive Compensation</value>
</data>
<data name="HRn1Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The process of determining how much to pay executives varies from country to country, and different guidelines exist for companies regarding who makes the decisions, how public the compensation information can be, and what factors affect the level of pay that an executive is given.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The trend around the world today is toward performance-based compensation. Executive pay is wholly or in part based on the company's performance. In general, the better the company does, the more compensation the executives receive. Here are a few examples of compensation practices in different countries.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Japan&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;Japanese companies are not required to make executive pay information public, and they rarely do so. An exception is the handful of Japanese firms that are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which makes them subject to U.S. disclosure standards. In general, compensation in Japan is usually based on seniority, although the actual compensation package is formally decided by upper management. Some firms are beginning to experiment with merit pay, but there are not yet specific compensation committees to act on behalf of boards of directors.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Germany&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;German law does not require companies to disclose executive pay, although most German companies do include information on executive compensation in their annual reports. German corporate law states that executive compensation must be kept in direct proportion to the responsibilities of the executive and the economic position of the company. According to the law, if a company's financial situation deteriorates, the board of directors may lower the executives' compensation, although such a step is not required.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; In addition to the competitive environment, corporate law and investor pressure have a significant impact on executive compensation and its disclosure to the public. Publicly held firms must release information about the number of executives whose annual salaries fall within certain ranges. Companies in the UK have board compensation committees to determine executive salaries. These committees are generally controlled by outsiders who are not employed by the company. Investors have been putting pressure on companies to link performance compensation using clear and reasonable measurements, such as growth in earnings per share or rises in the stock price compared to an index.</value>

    <value>The role of giving and receiving gifts in business relationships varies widely around the world. In Japan, gifts play a significant role in building a business relationship. In most Western countries, giving gifts is more of a polite gesture than something that is expected. &lt;P&gt;The custom in countries of the Middle East and throughout Latin America is to exchange small gifts as a sign of friendship on the occasion of the second meeting. In these countries, the first visit is typically the time for introductions and getting to know one another. Bringing a gift to the second meeting shows that you think it's important to acknowledge the relationship officially as you continue to do business together.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;According to Japanese tradition, the proper gift reflects the giver's friendship, appreciation, and respect. When a colleague gives you a gift, you are expected to reciprocate at some time in the future with a gift of similar value. This indicates that you appreciate the gift you received and you feel the same level of commitment to the relationship. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When you exchange gifts with a Japanese business associate, here are a few things to keep in mind.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Give a gift that is related to your recipient's profession or hobby.&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Do not give money.&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Wrap the gift and transport it in a small shopping bag.&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Tell your colleague in advance that you have a gift to present.&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Give gifts in private, at the end of a visit.&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Present the gift with both hands.&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Don't expect the receiver to open the gift in front of you.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</value>

<data name="GGn2Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The custom of giving gifts when invited to a dinner party or staying as a guest in a private home varies greatly around the world. Typically, it is considered polite to bring something with you when you arrive at someone's home. The type of gift that's considered appropriate depends on the country. Make sure you understand the local customs as you select your gifts. &lt;UL&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Hong Kong:&lt;/B&gt; Gourmet chocolate, flowers, or handicrafts are appropriate gifts, as long as you have already been introduced to your host.&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Middle East:&lt;/B&gt; Writing instruments are a favorite in this region of the world. If you're visiting for dinner or a short period of time, a fountain pen is appropriate. If your stay is longer, consider bringing porcelain, crystal, or fine linens.&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Russia:&lt;/B&gt; Your Russian host will appreciate a bottle of liquor from abroad, cosmetics, cigarettes, candy, or flowers. (Make sure the bouquet contains an odd number of flowers.) If you stay with a family, bring gifts from abroad such as cigarettes, perfume, high-quality alcoholic beverages, or souvenirs.&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Latin America:&lt;/B&gt; Choose items that meet the special interests of your host.&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The United States and the United Kingdom:&lt;/B&gt; When you're invited to dinner, it isn't necessary to bring a gift, but flowers, a bottle of wine, or chocolates are always appreciated. If you stay in a home, a small handicraft from your country, sent with a follow up thank-you note, is welcomed but not expected. If you stay for an extended period of time, it's considered thoughtful to take your host out to dinner toward the end of your visit.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</value>

<data name="GGn3Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although gifts play an important role in business around the world, you run the risk of offending a colleague if you present an inappropriate gift. In many cases, a poor gift choice is worse than not offering a gift at all. &lt;P&gt;Every culture has specific items that are considered taboo or bad luck. Many of these traditions aren't followed as much these days by the younger generations or within more modern and global companies. However, it's a good idea to be somewhat conservative when you're deciding on a gift, particularly if the recipient is an older executive.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Here are some gifts that you should avoid in certain parts of the world:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Europe:&lt;/B&gt; Red roses symbolize a romantic relationship in many parts of Europe. An arrangement containing 13 flowers is considered bad luck in Germany and Switzerland. In addition, the preference is for flower arrangements to have an even number of flowers. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;China:&lt;/B&gt; Sharp objects symbolize the cutting off of the relationship. Clocks are not appropriate because the Mandarin phrase &lt;I&gt;to give a clock&lt;/I&gt; sounds the same as &lt;I&gt;to attend a dying parent&lt;/I&gt;. Handkerchiefs imply sadness. Never give an odd number of an item; odd numbers symbolize separation, loneliness, and death. Do not bring food when you're invited to a meal because that implies your host cannot provide enough food.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;The Middle East:&lt;/B&gt; Consuming alcohol is prohibited in the Islamic faith, so don't present wine or liquor to your host. Pigs are banned because they're considered scavengers, so you shouldn't bring pork products either.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;India:&lt;/B&gt; Cows are sacred in India, so items made from cowhide are very offensive.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Latin America:&lt;/B&gt; Since some of the world's finest leather goods are made in Latin America, it would be insulting to bring leather from another country. Also, chrysanthemums, white asters, carnations, and yellow and purple flowers are sent only for funerals.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Korea and Japan:&lt;/B&gt; Don't give items in groups of four or nine. The words in Korean and Japanese that sound the same as the words for four and nine are related to death. In Japan, individual flowers are only for courting, death, or an illness.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Germany, Switzerland, and Scandinavia:&lt;/B&gt; Keep your gifts simple. Large and expensive gifts are considered tasteless.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</value>

    <value>Receiving Gifts</value>
</data>
<data name="GGn4Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The etiquette surrounding how to receive gifts is not nearly as complex as that of gift-giving. However, there are some important cultural differences you should be aware of. &lt;P&gt;In Asian cultures, be sure to receive a gift with both hands. You should put the gift aside and open it at a later time. Unwrapping a gift in the giver's presence suggests greed and impatience on your part. Waiting to open a gift, on the other hand, avoids embarrassment for the giver or the receiver if the gift turns out to be inappropriate or disappointing. Traditionally in China, Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore, it was common to decline a gift up to three times out of politeness. Nowadays, one refusal is considered enough to show humility and respect for the giver.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In Western countries, protocol regarding gifts is more relaxed. When you receive a gift, it is acceptable for you to open it right away, even if you are with a group. You may also be encouraged to show your gift around. It is not customary to refuse gifts, although many companies in the United States discourage supervisors from accepting gifts from their&lt;BR&gt;staff members. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In Muslim countries, make sure you accept the gift with your right hand, as your left is considered unclean. Always accept a gift willingly. Refusing a gift is the same as refusing the offer of friendship. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Latin American countries vary in the appropriate timing for opening gifts. In Chile, for example, you are expected to open a gift in front of the giver. In Colombia, however, you should put the gift aside so that you don't appear greedy.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;If you're not careful in some cultures, you may receive an unexpected gift. People in Saudi Arabia, Peru, Greece, Korea, and many other countries take compliments about their material items very seriously. If you admire a piece of jewelry, a hat, or even the furniture in someone's office, the person may interpret your compliment as a hint that you would like the item as a gift. If someone offers you such a gift, be gracious and accept it. Refusing the gift at this point would be extremely impolite.</value>

    <value>Greeting Women</value>
</data>
<data name="GandIn3Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Addressing women can be tricky. If you insult a woman by being too informal, the results can be problematic. Staying informed about the level of acceptance, participation, and status of women in the global marketplace is crucial for success in business. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;One of the most difficult aspects of greeting a female colleague is knowing which title to use. In the United States, the term &lt;I&gt;Ms.&lt;/I&gt; (pronounced &lt;I&gt;mizz&lt;/I&gt;) was adopted in the early 1970s and is now commonly accepted. This term may be used for all women and does not indicate marital status. If a woman refers to herself as &lt;I&gt;Mrs.&lt;/I&gt; (married) or &lt;I&gt;Miss&lt;/I&gt;(unmarried), then you may do the same. In Germany, &lt;I&gt;Fraeulein&lt;/I&gt; is used only for very young women, as &lt;I&gt;Mademoiselle&lt;/I&gt; is in France. A businesswoman in those countries should be addressed as &lt;I&gt;Frau&lt;/I&gt; or &lt;I&gt;Madame&lt;/I&gt;, respectively, whether she is married or single. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Another custom that varies from country to country is a whether a woman's name changes when she gets married, and if it does, how it changes. It is increasingly more common for career women to keep their own family name when they get married, although there are quite a few variations.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In the United States, women sometimes choose to hyphenate their family name with their husband's surname (for example, Susan Jones-Baker). They also may use both names without the hyphen, using their family name as a middle name. Another approach is for a woman to use her family name in her business life but her husband's name in her personal life. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In China, there are a few different ways a married woman refers to herself. She may choose to use both her husband's last name and her last name, followed by her given name. There is also a specific title--&lt;I&gt;nu shi&lt;/I&gt;--that indicates a woman is married, and this title may follow the woman's given name in the previous example. Another option is to use just her husband's last name, followed by the title &lt;I&gt;tai tai&lt;/I&gt;. This is the equivalent of &lt;I&gt;Mrs.&lt;/I&gt; in English. &lt;/P&gt;</value>

    <value>Shaking Hands</value>
</data>
<data name="GandIn4Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The Western custom of handshaking has become universally accepted in international business. But the specifics of offering a handshake--how long, how firm, and to whom--vary from culture to culture. &lt;P&gt;In the United States, both men and women shake hands firmly. A handshake is appropriate at the first introduction, as well as among acquaintances at the beginning and end of a meeting or other gathering. In Europe and South America, handshaking is also common at most interactions. Throughout Europe, the length and firmness of the handshake vary, depending on the region. Generally, a handshake from a southern European is very firm and is held for significant amount of time, perhaps up to 15 seconds. Your new acquaintance may also grasp your arm with the left hand during the handshake. This is a gesture of friendship and shows a level of trust.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In Latin America, watch your host to see whether a handshake or a kiss on one or both cheeks is appropriate. Once your host feels that a friendship has been established, handshakes will likely give way to embraces. Be sure to shake hands with everyone present, and expect to stand close during the interaction. Shaking hands can take quite a while in Latin America, so be prepared to participate in an extended ritual. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;A traditional Middle Eastern greeting between men involves grasping each other's right hand, placing the left hand on the other's right shoulder, and exchanging kisses on each cheek. These greeting kisses, however, should only be between members of the same sex. Typically, men and women do not shake hands, although it is becoming more common for Middle Eastern men to exchange handshakes in a business setting with Western women.</value>

    <value>Advertising</value>
</data>
<data name="MKTn1Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Advertising is a very important part of product marketing. Designing an advertising campaign, positioning a product, and competing against similar products are very difficult tasks. These tasks become even more difficult when a company advertises internationally or to non-native speakers in its home country. In many cases, it's the language--the specific words or how they're used--that keeps companies from meeting their goals. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When companies design advertising campaigns for their home country's market, they typically use their home country's main language. To advertise products in other countries, then, they often simply translate the ads into the language of the countries where they want to do business. This process, however, does not account for cultural differences from country to country. And in some cases, the actual translations can cause problems for a company. Here are a few examples:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;German-based Lufthansa airlines tried using some of its existing advertising to increase its market share in South Korea. Lufthansa merely translated the words However, because the ads were designed to depict German culture and travel, most South Koreans found them confusing or irrelevant. Realizing their error, Lufthansa hired a South Korean advertising agency to develop a new campaign that would be culturally appropriate. &lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;The now-defunct Eastern Airlines once had a TV ad with the slogan "We earn our wings daily." To English speakers, this slogan inspired confidence and a belief that Eastern's employees were very dedicated to their jobs. When the ad was translated word-for-word into Spanish, however, the phrase meant "Our passengers arrive at their destinations as angels" --in other words, dead. This phrase definitely did not inspire confidence. When Eastern executives discovered the confusion, they canceled the campaign. &lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;General Motors introduced the Chevrolet Nova into South America in the 1970s, but the car never sold very well. As General Motors later learned, "No va" in Spanish means "doesn't go." Who would want a car that doesn't go? It took Chevrolet a while to figure out why their car wasn't successful in Spanish-speaking countries. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;Getting the words translated exactly right doesn't always help companies, and getting the words wrong can really hurt them. Cultural sensitivity and linguistic awareness are key to making advertising campaigns appeal to people around the world.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

    <value>Global Brands</value>
</data>
<data name="MKTn2Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Many companies are successful in their home countries, but what happens when they want to have global success? Some companies want their corporate image to be a worldwide one, whereas others focus on making sure that specific brands are successful across borders. As companies consider what type of global existence they want for themselves, there are several factors they need to keep in mind. Depending on their focus--corporate image or product brand success--they might take into account the features and functions of the products that represent the brand, the brand's image, or the character of the company. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;A product's&lt;B&gt; features and functions&lt;/B&gt; meet the basic needs of consumers. Does the product satisfy a particular need? Does it offer value for its price? Is it of good quality? Is the product consistent from purchase to purchase? A company that is striving for global branding must address these questions in each market and will often need to customize the product to suit local markets. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;One successful example is Procter &amp; Gamble's Tide brand detergent. The fundamental purpose of the product has always been the same: Get clothes the cleanest they can be. Yet, since its introduction in 1956, the product has changed 70 times and in many ways to fit different markets and respond to customer preferences. In Europe, for example, people wash their clothes in near-boiling water, much hotter than the standard in other countries. Because of this, Procter &amp; Gamble needed to add a specific chemical to the Tide formula to make sure that the detergent would be effective in those conditions.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;A product's&lt;B&gt; image &lt;/B&gt;affects a consumer's emotional feeling for that brand. Does the brand represent luxury? Is it sophisticated? Is it fun? Is it practical? Does it give consumers a feeling of kinship with others? The emotional link with a product may determine whether consumers will try the product at all or continue to use it once they've tried it. Culture and social traditions have a natural impact on image preferences, and, therefore, companies need to be aware of local color when they are selling a product in multiple countries.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;DeBeers, the world's largest diamond company, has several advertising campaigns, each tailored to fit a particular culture. For example, products in Latin America are not marketed directly but rather are presented as associated with a desirable lifestyle. This type of advertising is extremely successful in Latin America, where people enjoy seeing how a product can positively affect their lives. In Germany, on the other hand, the message is basic and direct, showcasing the product without added context. Germans generally prefer understanding the specifics about why a product is reliable or of good quality rather than hypothesizing about how their lives will change because of it.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The &lt;B&gt;character &lt;/B&gt;of a corporation is also an important aspect of global branding, yet it is often the most difficult to establish. Successful companies understand clearly the values they want to embrace, and they find a way to communicate those values through the way they do business. The character a company portrays must be consistent to be effective. Once consumers identify certain elements of a company that they identify with and trust, they will assume that the company's brands and products also embody the same set of values. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;One example of consistency in corporate character is McDonald's. The company has made a commitment to family, fun, and value, and all of its marketing campaigns worldwide reflect that commitment. In addition, customer service and quality are at the top of the company's priority list, and, as a result, customers all over the world expect and receive consistent service and quality.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

<data name="MLSn1Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In many Asian cultures, how you conduct yourself during a meal is very important because your actions indicate a level of respect for your host and your eating companions.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Some general rules of etiquette apply to most Asian cultures. To begin with, you should not start eating until your host indicates that it is all right. If you are eating in a restaurant, let your host select and order all the food for the meal. When rice is served, make sure to receive the rice bowl with both hands, then hold the bowl in your left hand as you eat. If you are eating hot soup or noodles, it is acceptable to hold your bowl close to your mouth and slurp as you eat. Finally, you should make an effort to finish all portions of the meal at about the same time. When you are finished eating, make sure to cover your bowls.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;There are some differences in etiquette among Asian cultures. In Japan, you should raise your rice bowl to your mouth as you eat. In Korea, however, keep the bowl in your hand, just off the table. It is impolite at a Chinese meal to leave any food on your plate. You should do so in Korea, though, to indicate that your host provided more than enough food.</value>

    <value>When you deal with food in other cultures, there are two main rules you should remember. &lt;I&gt;&lt;P&gt;Rule number one&lt;/I&gt;: One person's favorite food may be another person's most hated meal. &lt;I&gt;Rule number two&lt;/I&gt;: Don't be judgmental about another culture's food. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;One of most challenging things to do in another culture is to politely refuse the cuisine. There often isn't a respectful way to tell a host that you don't want the food. When a luncheon or banquet is in your honor, you should not turn down your host's offering. The best strategy is to accept everything that is prepared for you. If something doesn't taste good to you, take small bites, pretend you like it, and swallow it quickly. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;A common custom among Asian people is to deny that they are hungry. If you would like a second helping when it is offered to you, you should follow this custom by refusing twice before accepting. Do not ask for more food, however. Your embarrassed Asian host will think that there is not enough food for the meal. On the other hand, Westerners tend to eagerly admit that they are hungry, so requesting additional servings is not considered impolite. In fact, a Western host who has prepared an elegant meal would be somewhat offended if you don't readily accept the food&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Every culture has some special dishes that are unique to that culture. Foods that might seem unusual to you may not surprise you as much if you know to expect them. In parts of Europe and the United States, you might find frogs legs, fish eggs (caviar), cow's tongue, or goose liver (foie gras). Around Asia, cultural favorites include bear paws, bat soup, and jellyfish. In parts of Africa and the Middle East, your meal might include gorilla, beetles, or raw liver of lamb. &lt;/P&gt;</value>

<data name="MLSn3Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Does it matter where you sit when you dine with business colleagues? Yes! &lt;P&gt;In many Asian cultures, it is important to pay attention to where people sit at the table. Most Asians use a low table and sit on the floor for meals. It is customary in both Japan and China for the honored guest to sit facing the door and the host sitting opposite the honored guest, facing away from the door. This practice comes from ancient times, when turning one's back toward the door indicated a level of comfort that there was no planned military attack. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In Middle Eastern cultures, seating is usually circular, but not necessarily around a table. Again, everyone might sit on the floor. Middle Easterners seat the most important guest to the right of the host. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;At business meals in Asia and the Middle East, women and men may share the same table, but often the men sit together at one part of the table and women sit at another. In Western countries, there typically aren't strict seating rules, although the most important people usually sit at the head of a rectangular table, with the highest-ranking guest sitting next to the host or hostess. If the group is made up of women and men, the seating often alternates between male and female.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

    <value>Liquor can be an important part of the interactions during a business relationship. Appreciating the local alcoholic beverage in Asian countries (Korea's soju, Japan's sake, and China's maotai) shows that you are willing to relax with your colleagues. Refusing a drink is considered impolite. If you don't like to drink alcohol, don't decline with a simple &lt;I&gt;no&lt;/I&gt;. Instead, say that you are allergic or taking medication that prevents you from drinking so that your host will not be offended. &lt;P&gt;In most Moslem countries, on the other hand, drinking alcohol is illegal. If you request or serve alcohol when meeting with an Arab, you run the risk of ruining a deal or an entire business relationship.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Drinking wine with meals is customary in France. If you don't want any, turn your glass upside down before the meal begins. Avoid hard liquor before meals, as the French believe it deadens the taste buds.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Every culture has customary expressions--called &lt;I&gt;toasts--&lt;/I&gt;that are said before drinking. They are meant to communicate good wishes to the group. In Asia, the host generally offers a toast to the guest or guests at the beginning of the meal. During the meal, each visitor should make a toast to the host. In most countries, it is customary to raise your glass during a toast. You should watch your host to determine whether or not it's appropriate to stand. In the United States, anyone may propose a toast, before or during a meal. The toast may be directed at any member of the group. In England, however, it is not polite to toast someone who is older than you. Depending on which country you're visiting, the rules of toasting may be somewhat complicated. It's a good idea to observe others in your group to make sure you understand how to participate.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

<data name="MLSn4Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Different cultures around the world have different eating utensils. In addition to learning the physical skills to use the utensils, it is important to understand the customs that go along with using them correctly. &lt;P&gt;Most people in Western countries eat with forks, knives, and spoons. There are two main styles for using these utensils, and each has unique rules. The continental style is used in many countries (although not in the United States). According to this style, the proper way to use the utensils is to keep the fork in one hand and the knife in the other as you cut your food and eat it. Placing the utensils together toward the bottom of the plate indicates that you're finished. The American style requires a bit more effort. After you have cut your food, it is proper to put down your knife and switch your fork to the other hand to eat. When you are finished with your meal, you should place the utensils on the plate so they are pointing toward the left side.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In most Asian countries, chopsticks are the utensils of choice. Once you have mastered holding and using them properly, make sure you observe the etiquette of the country you're in. For example, in China, it is rude to pick up single grains of rice with the chopsticks. In many Asian countries, it is considered bad luck to place your chopsticks so they stick into your rice. If you want to pause during the meal, place the chopsticks on the chopstick rest or across the top of the bowl. When you're finished, place them side by side on the rest or on the side of the bowl, but do not put them on the table.</value>

    <value>The rules for how and when you are seated at a restaurant vary from culture to culture. In the United States, for example, people wait at the door of the restaurant until the table is cleared, wiped, and reset. A host or hostess then escorts them to the table. At many restaurants in Hong Kong, however, customers stand right at the table, behind the people who are eating. Once the meal is over, the customers who are waiting sit down immediately. In England, a host or hostess will ask you to be seated, but in France, you are likely to be offered a table with a simple gesture and no verbal invitation. &lt;P&gt;In Asian cultures, the visitor is considered to be the guest of honor. This person enters the restaurant and sits first. The seat of honor is the chair in the middle of the table facing the door. When you are offered this seat, you should refuse it at least once before agreeing to sit there. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In many countries, restaurants often have large tables set for many people. If your party is small, you may be expected to share a table with strangers. If you're planning to conduct a business meeting during the meal, you may not have the privacy you need. Be sure to find out ahead of time what the seating arrangements will be. Often it is not appropriate to request that your group have a table to itself.</value>

<data name="MwPn1Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Business cards are common around the world, but their necessity and the timing and manner of exchanging them varies greatly. In today's global marketplace, it is not uncommon for the cards to be printed with English on one side and the local language (if not English) on the other. Make sure you have a business card and understand how and when to use it. &lt;P&gt;In most of Europe and the Americas, business cards are exchanged only if there is a need for further contact. Typically they are presented at the conclusion of a meeting and placed in one's pocket. Portugal and Brazil are two exceptions, where cards are presented at the beginning of the meeting.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In East Asia, the business card is very important, and many people have special holders for storing the cards. Businesspeople exchange their cards the first time they meet so they're able to understand each other's position and title. In Japan, people use both hands to make the exchange. In Korea, the right hand is used, with the left hand supporting the right forearm. When you receive a card, read it carefully, noting the title and making sure you know the correct pronunciation of the presenter's name and title. Never write on business cards or put them in your pocket. During a meeting, place the cards in front of you on the table, in the order that corresponds to where people are sitting.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

</data>
<data name="MwPn2Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The impression you make on a business colleague isn't complete until you've concluded your meeting. Partings are as important as greetings, and they can affect the relationship you're trying to build. In a well-conducted meeting, the progression from small talk to business to the conclusion should be gradual and graceful. An impatient and disrespectful parting can destroy a successful meeting. &lt;P&gt;In most countries, the visitor is expected to initiate the closing of a meeting, since it would be rude for the host to do so. If a host ended a meeting, that would be considered the same as asking the visitor to leave. However, a host might hint that a meeting should be ending by changing the topic of conversation from business to small talk. In China, Korea, and other Asian countries, it is the responsibility of the host to signal the end of the meeting, and the visitor should watch for signs that it is time to go. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In general, you shouldn't rush a business meeting. Make sure you understand the agenda and the overall purpose of the gathering so you'll know what to expect during the course of the meeting. As the discussion progresses, you will be able to keep track of the topics that need to be covered. This will help you have a sense for when the meeting is getting close to the end.</value>

    <value>First Impressions</value>
</data>
<data name="MwPn3Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Whether we think about it or not, we all make judgments about people when we first meet them. In Western countries, a first impression is often based on someone's clothes, a smile, firmness of a handshake, or the kind of car someone drives. This quick evaluation helps people assess how compatible they think they are with the other person. It also helps them figure out what kind of interaction they want to have. &lt;P&gt;In addition to visual cues, people in the East form first impressions of people based on their &lt;I&gt;relative status&lt;/I&gt; and their &lt;I&gt;relationship&lt;/I&gt; with one another. They often ask questions about age, company rank, university, and city of family origin. In addition, observing an acquaintance's depth of bow, level of eye contact, and formality of language helps form the impression and determine social status. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In most Asian countries, these first impressions are extremely significant. Once the status difference has been defined, two people can communicate with each other more appropriately. You should make sure that you understand your position relative to your colleagues so that the way you speak will not be offensive to them.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

    <value>Time for Small Talk</value>
</data>
<data name="MwPn4Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Most people feel the need to make sure everyone in a group is comfortable before they start a business meeting. This pre-business conversation--&lt;I&gt;small talk&lt;/I&gt;--can cover a wide range of topics, some of which may not be related to the agenda for the meeting. In most countries, building personal connections is a crucial first step in making sure that business goes smoothly. People often use this phase of the interaction to observe and assess the character of their colleagues. &lt;P&gt;In the Middle East, businesspeople like to get to know new acquaintances before starting a meeting. They often judge people's responses to certain topics by observing their eyes, so they need to be able to sit or stand very close to the person. Small talk tends to continue until the people involved are comfortable enough to move close to one another. In Latin American and Asian countries, people also want to determine if an acquaintance can be trusted. For them, business is conducted with an individual, not a company, so it's important to have an honest relationship before any business is discussed.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In the United States, however, most businesspeople prefer an extremely limited small talk period. When they arrive for a meeting, they expect to begin the business discussion right away, perhaps after just a few minutes of greetings and introductions. Most Americans feel that time is as valuable as money, so talking extensively about the weather, hobbies, or the plane trip is seen as a waste of time. They are likely to become impatient if the subject turns away from the business of the day.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

    <value>Informal conversation is an important part of any business relationship. Before you start a discussion, however, make sure you understand which topics or behaviors are appropriate and which are considered taboo in a particular culture. &lt;P&gt;Latin Americans enjoy sharing information about their local history, art, and customs. Expect questions about your family, and be sure to show pictures of your children. You may feel free to ask similar questions of your Latin American colleagues. The French think of conversation as an art form, and they appreciate the value of lively discussions as well as disagreements. For them, arguments can be entertaining--and they can cover pretty much any topic--as long as they occur in a respectful and intelligent manner. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In the United States, businesspeople like to discuss a wide range of topics, including opinions about work, family, hobbies, and politics. In Japan, China, and Korea, however, people are much more private. They do not share much about their thoughts, feelings, or emotions because they feel that doing so might take away from the harmonious business relationship they're trying to build. Middle Easterners are also private about their personal lives and family matters. It is considered rude, for example, to ask a businessman from Saudi Arabia about his wife or children.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;As a general rule, it's best not to talk about politics or religion with your business colleagues. This can get you into trouble, even in the United States, where people hold diverse--and sometimes very passionate--views. In addition, discussing one's salary is usually considered inappropriate, as is the cost of one's house, car, or other personal property. Sports is typically a friendly subject in most parts of the world, although be careful not to criticize a national sport. Instead, be diplomatic and praise your host's team.</value>

</data>
<data name="MwPn6Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The protocol for making an initial business contact and appointment can range from a simple telephone call to a letter sent several months in advance to having a local coordinator arrange an introduction. Your approach will vary, depending on the formality expected by businesspeople in the specific country. &lt;P&gt;When you need to do business in Europe and the Middle East, sending an introductory letter is the safest approach. In Western Europe, three to four weeks ahead of time is considered polite. In the Middle East, six weeks in advance is usually the minimum. Businesspeople in Asian countries generally follow very formal protocol and expect written contact in advance, although some Indonesian businesses will accommodate people who stop by unannounced. Unless you are sure that another language is appropriate or preferred, you should write your introductory correspondence in the recipient's native language. The response you receive will indicate whether or not future communication may be in another language. One exception is Hong Kong, where English is considered to be the language of business.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In many Asian countries, direct requests for appointments are inappropriate. You will need the assistance of a go-between--someone who can represent you to the business in question. In China, allow two to three months of lead time for your local contact to secure an appointment and establish your credibility.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In the United States, it is acceptable to arrange an initial appointment on the telephone or in writing. You should call or send a letter enough in advance to make sure the people you need to meet with can fit you into their schedule. You should allow more time for higher-level executives because they tend to have more commitments than other people in the company. &lt;/P&gt;</value>

<data name="MNYn1Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In many countries, bargaining or haggling over a price for a product or service is a way of life--something that brings fun and laughter to both the merchant and the customer. As a visitor to a foreign country, you should feel free to engage local merchants in bargaining. You may not ultimately receive the same low price that the locals get, but you can certainly expect to get a good deal. Remember to be polite, be patient, and do not get angry during the back-and-forth ritual. This may cause the merchant to raise the price instead of lower it. Here is what you can expect if you travel to certain regions of the world.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Most prices in Middle Eastern and African markets and stores are negotiable. Hotels, restaurants, and public transportation (not including taxis) are the exception. Most merchants who sell at markets expect to bargain for almost everything they offer. In some Muslim countries, you may be served tea as part of the bargaining ritual. Go ahead and accept the tea, even if you aren't sure whether or not you will be buying anything. Drinking the tea does not obligate you to make a purchase. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;In Eastern European countries, bargaining is common at outdoor stands that sell crafts, household goods, and fruits and vegetables, but never at government-owned shops.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;In Latin America, you may negotiate the price for accommodations, especially late in the evening and for longer stays. Once you have agreed on a price, you should get it in writing. In addition, marketplaces (especially craft markets) and unmetered taxis are good places to bargain for lower prices.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;In Asia, the popularity of bargaining varies from country to country. It is more common in Thailand, Hong Kong, Korea, and Indonesia and less common in Singapore, China, Japan, and the Philippines, except for the outdoor markets. In those countries where bargaining is an accepted practice, you can generally bargain at any market except for supermarkets and department stores.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Businesses in the United States rely primarily on fixed prices. Two areas where you can negotiate the price are real estate and automobiles.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</value>

    <value>Making Phone Calls</value>
</data>
<data name="TPHOn1Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>For many reasons, communicating over the telephone can be more difficult than speaking with someone in person. You can't observe the speaker's facial expressions and other body language, so pronunciation and listening skills are particularly important. However, there are several ways you can prepare for a telephone conversation with someone from another country to make sure it is successful. To begin with, make notes in advance so you won't forget something important. Take notes during the call, and send written confirmation afterward on essential issues. &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Here are some additional things you should keep in mind:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;/B&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Always introduce yourself by using both your first and last name, and make sure you identify the company you are with. Be sure to speak slowly and clearly.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Repeat important information to make sure everything is clear. Spell names and say each digit of a number individually to avoid any misunderstanding. Be patient, and repeat the information when necessary.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Verify that you are talking to the correct person before you discuss specific details.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Be aware that your counterpart may not be giving you his or her complete attention. In many countries, it is common for businesspeople to be on the computer, reading, or even in a meeting while they are on the phone.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</value>

<data name="TPHOn2Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although more and more of the world's business is being done over the telephone these days, there are still significant differences in how much emphasis various cultures place on using it. In countries where telephones are not widely available, businesspeople communicate in person or in writing. Once telephones do become more available, however, cultural preferences do not automatically change. Make sure you understand how your international colleagues like to conduct business so you can approach them in the most efficient way possible. &lt;P&gt;In Latin America and Eastern Europe, the telecommunications infrastructure has greatly improved in recent years, and service is becoming more reliable. However, in some Latin American countries, including those with major commerce centers, businesses still have to wait up to six months to get a phone installed. Many business people get around this problem by using cellular phones, which are readily available in most countries. In Eastern Europe, phone services range from relatively good to fairly poor. To use a telephone in this region, you will likely need to go to a post office and use a public telephone center, so it may be easier for you to get in touch with a colleague if you go directly to the office. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In the United States, the telephone is a time-saving tool. A phone call can be more efficient than a meeting because there aren't the distractions that often occur during an in-person gathering. In general, Americans like business calls to be quick, polite, and informative. To make sure they are spending their time effectively, many businesspeople in the U.S. will screen their calls--that is, they choose to answer only some of the calls that come in. Most businesspeople have voice mail or another messaging system in place, so they're able to communicate very effectively through messages. Sometimes, several calls and messages will go back and forth without the people involved ever speaking to one another. This is referred to as &lt;I&gt;phone tag&lt;/I&gt;, and it is very common throughout business in the U.S. People will make appointments, share important information, or even settle negotiations without ever having a live conversation.</value>

    <value>Business Hours and Customs</value>
</data>
<data name="TIMEn1Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The appropriate times and places to do business vary quite a bit around the world. Many factors affect a given culture's accepted business hours, including vacation, weather, religious holidays, and preferences for scheduling in advance. The customs of four countries are highlighted below. &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The typical work week in the Czech Republic runs Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. However, if you arrive at a business during the regular work week and you don't have an appointment, you may not be able to conduct your business. You should try to make an appointment two weeks to a month in advance. In addition, most Czechs take four weeks of vacation from mid-July to mid-August, so very little business is conducted during this time period.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Most business in the Czech Republic is conducted in offices, although business lunches are beginning to gain popularity. Typically, business is discussed before and after the meal, but not during the meal itself. Business breakfasts or dinners are very uncommon. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Finland&lt;/B&gt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;The Finnish work week is generally Monday through Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. or 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. in the winter. As in the Czech Republic, it's wise to schedule your appointments several weeks in advance. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In Finland many businesses close the afternoon before a national holiday as well as on the day itself. In addition, because most Finns take four to five weeks of vacation during July and August, it is both inconsiderate and impractical to try to schedule business meetings during those months.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;India&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;The usual work week in India is Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The country observes many religious holidays during the year, and no business is conducted on those days.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Although meetings are frequently scheduled at least two months in advance, meeting days and times tend to be flexible so you should allow for last-minute changes. Also be aware that middle managers will schedule appointments for any time during the workday, but senior executives often prefer to meet in the late morning or early afternoon. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;France&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/B&gt;Most businesses in France operate from 8:00 a.m. until 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, although government office hours are 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Many stores are closed on Mondays since they open on Saturdays, although that custom is starting to change and many stores are making an effort to be open on Monday afternoons.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;It is common for businesses to close for an hour or two at lunchtime, usually starting at noon. Traditionally, employees would go home and eat lunch with their families, returning to work within two hours, although this practice is starting to change in some areas, particularly in the larger cities. It is still common for people to go home for lunch if they have children, however, since schools take a long lunch break and all children eat at home. People who take two hours for lunch will usually add some time to the end of the day and finish work around 6:00 p.m. or 6:30 p.m.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;There are many national holidays that are observed in France as well as several religious holidays, and all businesses are closed on those days. In addition, most people take five weeks of vacation each year. In the past, vacation typically happened in July or August, with people taking an entire month off at once. Nowadays, people tend to take shorter summer vacations--two or three weeks--and then use the rest of their vacation during other times of the year, perhaps around certain holidays.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

    <value>Most societies have a cultural tendency that determines how they organize their time. It can be helpful when doing business internationally to understand a culture's preferences regarding time so that your expectations of your colleagues' behavior can be realistic. &lt;P&gt;The cultures of Northern Europe and the United States typically consider time to be a valuable commodity that should not be wasted. You'll often hear people refer to time being spent, saved, lost, or killed. These cultures rely on careful planning and scheduling to keep things in order and moving. Some of the values of these cultures include the following:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;doing one thing at a time&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;concentrating on the job without interruptions&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;taking time commitments (deadlines, schedules, appointments ) very seriously&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;preferring to stick to plans already defined&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;emphasizing promptness&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;being accustomed to short-term business relationships&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;By contrast, cultures in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and Latin America focus on the involvement of people and the completion of projects rather than on schedule. Time is not tangible, so it can't really be wasted. The pace is more relaxed, spontaneous, and unstructured. Some of the values of these cultures include the following:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;doing more than one thing at once&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;being accustomed to interruptions during business meetings&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;considering the project more important than meeting the deadline&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;being flexible and willing to change plans or appointments easily&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;building lifetime business relationships&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;Of course, not everyone in a given culture has the exact same philosophy about time, so it's always a good idea to find out about individual preferences in addition to understanding any cultural tendencies.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

    <value>Punctuality</value>
</data>
<data name="TIMEn3Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Our expectations regarding punctuality often come from the cultural norms of our own societies. In general, lateness is either tolerated or it isn't, although there is often some flexibility, depending on the particular situations or the people involved. &lt;P&gt;In many regions of the world--including the United States, Great Britain, Switzerland, Germany, Scandinavia, and parts of Asia--it is usually acceptable to be five minutes late for a business appointment, but anything more than 15 minutes late is considered rude. Arriving late to a meeting may also indicate irresponsibility, a lack of interest in the proceedings, or even a feeling of superiority toward those kept waiting. Arriving too early, on the other hand, may suggest too much eagerness about the meeting, or it may imply that one has too much free time. In these cultures, there is often more freedom for certain people. For example, a vice president can be late for a meeting, but the junior staff needs to be on time. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In most parts of Asia--including Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea, and Japan--punctuality is also generally expected. In urban areas where traffic is extremely congested, arriving on time may be difficult, but you should plan for additional travel time to make sure you arrive promptly. In China, arriving early for a business appointment shows respect for someone you don't know. Many businesspeople link punctuality to integrity. They believe that if you aren't on time, you may not turn out to be a trustworthy business partner.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In other parts of the world, particularly Latin America, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and Africa, it is common for businesspeople to arrive late or not come at all to appointments. Although people often try to be on time, no one is offended if they are late. In these cultures, it is not a good idea to dwell on others' punctuality. If you find yourself waiting for others at a gathering, be careful not to show impatience when they do arrive. This is inappropriate and shows a lack of respect for your colleagues.</value>

    <value>The Ritual of Bowing</value>
</data>
<data name="GandIn1Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Although the Western custom of shaking hands has become universal, the international businessperson should understand the ritual of bowing that is still practiced throughout Asia. Bowing is a highly cultivated art form and shouldn't be imitated lightly. &lt;P&gt;A bow may be an expression of deference, devotion, or apology, or it might simply indicate &lt;I&gt;hello&lt;/I&gt; or &lt;I&gt;goodbye&lt;/I&gt;. Bowing is part of nearly every interaction in Korea and Japan. It is such an important element in the definition of a relationship that an employee might even bow into the phone when speaking to the boss. In China and Taiwan, bowing to show respect continues to be a traditional ceremony, although it is no longer practiced in Singapore.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The appropriate bow depends on one's status and age relative to the other person. In both Japan and Korea, the person who holds the lower status bows first, bows deeper, and rises last. This ritual can take as long as 30 seconds. When strangers bow, they ask polite questions and watch their counterparts until it becomes clear which person holds the higher status. They then continue the interaction, using appropriate language and bowing depth. In all cases, the deeper the bow, the higher the respect. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When you bow, your back should be straight and your feet should be together. Koreans usually bow only once, keeping their palms on their buttocks. Japanese place their palms on their thighs and may bow a number of times to emphasize respect or humility.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In Thailand and India, businesspeople greet each other with a modified bow. They hold their palms together at chest level, dipping the head toward the hands. The higher the hands and lower the head, the greater the show of respect. As in Japan and Korea, the person of lower status should bow first.</value>

<data name="TIMEn4Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The relative importance that a culture places on the past, present, and future can have an effect on the philosophies that companies have about doing business. Most companies plan carefully for the future by researching their target markets and developing timelines for designing, manufacturing, and delivering goods or services. In this sense, strategies, goals, and objectives are all future oriented. However, past experiences and present realities affect the choices that companies make. The interaction among past, present, and future varies from country to country. &lt;P&gt;The United States is an example of a future-oriented culture. In business, there is typically a lot of emphasis on the future, and companies are continually striving to ensure that the future will be better than the present. Most businesspeople in the U.S. are generally optimistic about what the future holds, and most of what their daily actions are is geared toward achieving ongoing positive change.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Past-oriented cultures include China, Japan, Great Britain, France, Africa, and the Middle East. Past events hold a lot of importance in these cultures, and history, protocol, and traditions often help guide businesspeople in making decisions. In these countries, longevity is viewed as a positive, and old things are valued. The sense of tradition is evident in the fact that there is a lot of emphasis on loyalty and commitment in the workplace.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Some present-oriented cultures include the Philippines and Latin America. These cultures believe that the present moment holds the most significance, partly because the future is unknown. Generally speaking, businesspeople in these cultures have a more relaxed work style. They don't work specifically to achieve future goals or rewards, but they typically feel an ongoing obligation to their companies. However, if they are no longer enjoying their work, they are more likely to leave the company and look for another job.</value>

<data name="TIMEn5Bdy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Schedules and deadlines mean different things in different societies. Throughout most of Northern Europe and the United States, meeting deadlines is a critical part of business. Delays are often met with impatience or irritation. In the business world, most projects have clearly defined timelines, and missing one deadline may affect multiple tasks. You should be aware that delays will often be met with impatience or irritation from your colleagues. In Japan, schedules are also very important in the business world, but delays are common because of the complex and lengthy decision-making process that takes place in many Japanese businesses. Typically, projects need the full approval of managers at each level before they can begin, so you should be prepared to be patient as a project gets underway. Once it's started, though, you can count on the timeline being followed. &lt;P&gt;Deadlines in the Mediterranean, Latin America, and the Middle East don't often indicate when a project will actually be finished. Deadlines exist, but not meeting them is common, and businesspeople expect timelines to change during the course of a project. In these cultures, certain working relationships or processes are allowed to develop at their own pace, so sticking to one timeline isn't always practical. You can suggest a deadline, but allow for flexibility and don't be too aggressive about meeting it. To an Arab businessman, this may indicate a lack of trust on your part. And in Ethiopia, matters that take a long time to complete are considered prestigious. You don't want to appear to be lessening the importance of a project by insisting that it be completed quickly.</value>

    <value>As business becomes more global, international traveling is more commonplace. The accommodations businesspeople encounter around the world vary, although many hotels have adopted a Western style and offer their guests a wide range of services, including restaurants, business services, and exercise facilities. Before you travel, take some time to find out what you can expect once you arrive at your destination. &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Asia&lt;/P&gt; &lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Although it's usually a good idea to make your hotel arrangements ahead of time, many international airports have hotel reservation desks. When you reserve a room, make sure you understand the different options that are available to you. In Chinese hotels, for example, a single room has a double bed, but a double room has two beds. In Hong Kong, the more expensive hotels have private baths in each room, but many of the moderately price hotels have shared bathrooms. In Indonesia, the traditional washroom contains a large tank of water. Although it may resemble a bathtub or wash basin, you should not climb into this tank. Use the cup provided to scoop out the water you need to use. Throughout Asia, you'll find sit-up toilets and standing showers in the more upscale hotels, but you can expect the more traditional hole-in-the-floor varieties in many of the older or smaller hotels. &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Eastern Europe&lt;/P&gt; &lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;Throughout Eastern Europe, you may find hotel reservation desks at the airport, although you are more likely to get the hotel information you need--for a small fee--from a tourist office. Most hotels in Eastern Europe don't offer single rooms. People in those countries typically don't travel alone, so they don't expect other travelers to be alone either. You should be prepared to eat breakfast at your hotel. The meal is considered part of your stay, although there usually is an additional charge. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In many Eastern European countries, you will need to turn over your passport and visa when you register into a hotel. You can expect to get them back within 24 hours. In Hungary, you'll get your passport back once the clerk has recorded the necessary information. In Russian hotels, you will receive an identification card showing the hotel's name and your room number. You will need to present the card when you exchange money or if you visit a hotel other than the one where you're staying. The card indicates that you have official accommodations and a legitimate reason for being in the country.</value>

    <value>When being introduced for the first time, most businessmen around the globe prefer to be addressed as &lt;I&gt;Mr.&lt;/I&gt; (or a similar title) plus their surname. In the United States, people often use the first and last names without &lt;I&gt;Mr.&lt;/I&gt; or a title: "Steve Lopez, I'd like you to meet Tim Hogan." This indicates that it is appropriate to use first names, even at the beginning of a relationship. In most Latin American countries, titles such as doctor or professor are preferred, and a formal introduction includes two surnames: first the father's, then the mother's. (In Brazil, the mother's surname comes first.) However, in most everyday interactions, it is common to address men directly using just their father's surname. &lt;P&gt;In most Asian countries, names are listed in a different order than they are in the Western world. The family name typically comes first, often followed by a title. Proper pronunciation is extremely important, so repeat the name of your new acquaintance to be sure you're pronouncing it correctly. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The Indonesian custom of introduction is one of the most formal in the world. It is important to recognize and respect the preferred greeting sequence: Bapak (&lt;I&gt;Mr.&lt;/I&gt;); academic title, if any; title of nobility, if any; given and family name; business title.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;For example, a formal introduction for a male executive with the given name Juanda and the family name Kusumaatmaja, could contain all of these elements: Bapak Doctor His Excellency Juanda Kusumaatmaja, Chief Accountant.&lt;/P&gt;</value>

    <value>When business colleagues or clients visit your country, their expectations about hospitality will vary, depending on the customs in their home countries. To make sure that you show your visitors the appropriate respect and courtesy, it is best to raise your standard of hospitality to the highest possible level. &lt;P&gt;It is fairly safe to assume that many visitors will expect an official greeting at the airport as well as assistance in finding and settling into their hotel. Here are some specific suggestions for making your visitors feel welcome as soon as they arrive in your country.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Have a representative from your company meet the airplane and personally handle the luggage. Ideally, the representative should be fluent in the visitor's language. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Make hotel reservations for your guests and confirm their reservations before &lt;BR&gt;they arrive. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Meet with the hotel staff to alert them to any special needs your guests might have (dietary restrictions, medical problems, and so on).&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Have flowers, fruit, candy, and perhaps tea or coffee from your visitors' home country in their rooms prior to arrival.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Accompany your guests to their rooms and help them get acquainted with the &lt;BR&gt;hotel's services.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Arrange for a copy of their hometown newspaper to be delivered each morning.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Allow for plenty of rest time before the first scheduled meeting. Your visitors will likely be suffering from jet lag.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Give your guests a list of necessary phone numbers and a written itinerary for their visit. Give them whatever information they may need to find their way around &lt;BR&gt;the city.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;Offer to assist them with arranging a wake-up call.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;</value>
