There are, however, many different mindsets. Generalising seems politically incorrect but South Africans are surprisingly direct when it comes to categorising one another, which can take some getting used to for overseas visitors. </p> <p>English-speaking whites, for example, are calm, relatively reserved, hospitable, conflict-avoiding and approach business in a more British style. Afrikaaners are famously brash, outspoken, direct, stubborn and impatient at the same time as being warmly hospitable and outgoing. Blacks are influenced by their tribal background, family and level of education and have been&nbsp;climbing the long hill towards equality, socially and economically since the end of the apartheid era. Asians and coloureds, meanwhile, are hard-working, family orientated, conservative, often highly educated and skilled in business. </p>"

      "body": " <p>South Africa is not a melting pot as such, but rather a collection of communities living side by side. There are nine major black 'tribes', who together make up 75% of the population. They include the Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho, Swazi, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda, Xhosa, Zulu. Of these, the Xhosa (18%) and Zulus (23%) are the largest. The Xhosa, Zulu and Ndebele are all closely related. </p> <p>There are over six million white people living in South Africa, split mainly between the Afrikaans (Dutch) and English heritage, although a number of French Huguenots settled in the <img alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Southa.1;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Cape in the 18th century. There are also small but significant Jewish, Italian, Greek and Portuguese communities. </p> <p>The 'coloured' or mixed race population of about 3.6 million includes a range of ethnic heritages, including mixed black; white; the Cape Malays, descendants of the mainly Indonesian 18th-century house slaves; and the aboriginal KhoiSan people (Bushmen and Hottentots). Because of the effects of generations of apartheid, the coloured population has developed into a separate racial and cultural group. </p> <p>The country also has an Indian population of around one million, many of whom were brought in as indentured workers for the sugarcane plantations and the railways. Others followed as small traders. Most live in Kwazulu-Natal. </p> <p>There is negative population growth and a high infant mortality rate. Many of the 5.3 million people living with HIV or AIDS are of working age, which is having a devastating effect on the working population. </p>"

      "body": " <p>Working with South Africans means establishing a common goal and taking a long-term view. The aim should be to offer guidance and training, and to work with a South African team, rather than taking an imperialistic attitude, which may have been the way in the past. Cultural sensitivity is important at all times, not just to the different ethnic groups in South <img alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Southa.4;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Africa but, for example, to those living with HIV. Many companies have an inclusive policy for these people.</p> <p>It is important to behave with honour and to do what you say you're going to do. Be punctual for meetings and do not try a heavy sell, or make false claims. The business community is small and word gets around. Having said this, adjust to the South African notion of time. South Africans don't like to be thought of as using 'Africa time' (ie very slow with no regard for deadlines) but are nonetheless more laid back than Europeans and Americans.</p> <p>South Africans may be apologetic and critical of their country, but it's important that you leave this to them. Be positive and enthusiastic. Aim to build personal relationships with colleagues, customers and suppliers.</p> <p>Accept invitations and return them if you can; hospitality is important here.</p>"

Expect to socialise with your business counterparts, and expect some fairly direct questions about your background. </p> <p>Black South Africans appreciate recognition for their achievements, a long-term outlook and fair treatment. Asians are industrious, conservative and respectful of their elders. English-speaking White South Africans are calm, reserved, linear-thinking and generally speaking, prefer to avoid conflict. Afrikaners, meanwhile, are much more direct and blunt in their approach. Recognising these cultural differences and acknowledging them and responding appropriately will all help. </p> <p>What all cultural groups have in common is a long-term commitment to their country's future and any visitor who understands this is off to a good start. Offer long-term solutions to problems, accept that return on investment may be slow and avoid criticising the way things were done in the past.</p>"

      "title": "Business Etiquette",
      "body": " <p>While business culture here pretty much follows what happens in Europe or the USA, you must be mindful that South Africa is not that far down the road from a very painful era. While the government has ordered companies to ensure their workforces are inclusive, it has not been easy given the neglect to black education during the apartheid years. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Southa.6;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">You may find some black South Africans preferring to be called \"African\" rather than black, although by the same token, there are many whites who would object to not being called African. Following what others say is likely to be your best option for not causing offence.</p> <p>Race is still an extremely emotive issue and while they will be courteous, people are sensitive to the slightest possible slur. At the same time, they are often eager to discuss political issues. It is good to show interest, and ask questions but refrain from making judgements. Never make comments or tell jokes that could be seen as the slightest bit racist or sexist.</p> <p>Some South Africans are extremely sophisticated, used to dealing at high level in a global market; others are extremely parochial. All, without exception, will apologise for the shortcomings of their country while firmly believing that South Africa and all things in it are the finest in the world. They do not like criticism and will regard even constructive criticism as a slur unless it is carefully handled. </p> <p>South Africans possess a basic willingness to please which can show itself in people going out of their way to arrange something in which you've expressed a casual interest, and, at times, in them giving you the answer they think you want rather than the true one. Be careful how you phrase things.</p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>&nbsp;South Africans are open, friendly, laid-back and physical. Communication style (especially among Afrikaaners)&nbsp;is direct and explicit. A South African may stand close to, and frequently touch, the person they are talking to. To back away from the&nbsp;physical contact&nbsp;could be seen as an expression of mistrust or unfriendliness. </p> <p>People are genuinely interested in building up a real relationship with a visitor, so business conversation may well be interspersed with more personal questions. There are cultural differences in the style of discussion. White South Africans are generally very straightforward and appreciate the same from others. Few black African cultures prize this as a skill, preferring to talk around the subject more; they may sometimes agree with a point to please you, rather than from conviction. Similarly, they may not admit that they do not know an answer because of the desire not to disappoint you.</p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>South Africans, black and white, are more tactile than most northern Europeans, so expect to be touched, hugged or slapped on the back. Do not draw back. Eye contact is regarded as a way of judging trustworthiness, so don't wear dark glasses or let your eyes wander during negotiations. Be sure to focus on all the people in the room during a group meeting. </p> <p>Snapping your fingers to gain attention, pointing at people to emphasise a point and putting your hands in your pockets while talking are all poor manners. Resting your left hand on your right forearm while shaking hands or handing over anything from a business card to a jug of water is a sign of respect in black culture, usually used to elders.</p> <p>It is important to appear to be an attentive listener, particularly as someone might touch your arm when making a point, use gestures when talking and expect you to nod or murmur occasionally to show you are listening. Long silences are uncomfortable rather than a time for reflection, so try to keep conversation moving.</p> <p><b>Gift giving</b></p> <p>Gift-giving is not an essential part of the business culture and gifts are generally only given once a personal relationship has been established. Keep things small and, if possible, personal - something you know will be of value specifically to your counterpart, whether it is a beer tankard or a box of golf balls. Or take something typical from your own country. Small gifts given to junior staff at the end of a successful visit are a nice touch.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Business cards</b></p> <p>Business cards are generally exchanged at the start of a meeting. They should clearly show your name and job title as well as the company's contact details and, preferably, your direct line and email address. </p>"

      "title": "Business Meeting Culture",
      "body": " <p>The tone of a meeting depends very much on the ethnic group with which you are doing business. Not only do black and white South Africans (and groups within each category, such as the Afrikaaners and British) come from different cultural backgrounds, but they have generally reached their position in life by different routes and have different priorities. The Afrikaaners are sometimes frighteningly blunt and prefer a no-nonsense approach. The British-descent South Africans&nbsp;like the civilities to be preserved while getting straight to the point. The black Africans generally take a more circuitous route and are less easy to pin down. Any meeting needs to be adjusted to fit the culture of its attendees if you want results.</p> <p><b>Planning a meeting</b></p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Southa.7;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Make an appointment by phone or email in plenty of time and reconfirm it before you arrive. Give a local contact number, as people tend to be a bit vague when it comes to arrangements.</p> <p>Business here is all about personal trust and relationships, so while using the name of a mutual acquaintance or a letter of introduction may open doors, using a formal intermediary can be counter-productive. Give people a good idea of your business, the reason for the meeting and your own background ahead of time.</p> <p>Visitors are expected to be punctual, but you will frequently be kept waiting.&nbsp; Last minute cancellations are common. Showing impatience at delays won't help and may hinder your chances of eventually getting a successful outcome to the meeting. Accept delays and cancellations gracefully and reschedule.</p> <p><b>During a meeting</b></p> <p>Meetings always start with refreshments and small talk; hospitality is a way of life here.</p> <p>As a visitor, it is important that you demonstrate some understanding of the complexities of South African politics and culture and tailor all arguments accordingly. You won't change the country, so you need to change your pitch and your methods to fit.</p> <p>Don't sell too hard - aggressiveness in trying to pin people down to a decision will put them off. Use a laid-back, friendly approach, but keep to the point and don't ramble. </p> <p><b>Following a meeting</b></p> <p>It is not unusual for a meeting to continue over lunch, during which your counterpart will continue to assess you. Alternatively, they may invite you to join them that evening or weekend.</p> <p>South Africans can be vague about follow-up and implementation, so take the initiative to contact everybody who was at the meeting with a list of action points.</p>"

A work/life balance is more important than spending as much time as possible in the office, certainly among white South Africans.

Once this judgement is made, the technical details can be dealt with. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Southa.9;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Presentations should be clear, concise, to the point and not condescending. Use visual as well as verbal communication. Polish your presentation, keep technical wizardry to a minimum, but take packs of well-presented material for people to take away and digest later. </p> <p>Be inclusive - don't just lecture about what you can do, but concentrate on what you and your South African counterparts can achieve together.</p> <p>Remember that you are being judged as an individual, not just a representative of your company. Maintain eye contact with the audience and appear friendly but professional. Dress smartly, but conservatively.</p> <p><b>Audience expectations</b></p> <p>A South African audience expects you to have done your homework on the intricacies of doing business in South Africa. How a deal will be set up and financed, and then implemented, is as important as the product itself. So focus on this and prepare for some direct questioning afterwards.</p>"

While it is essential to treat everybody equally, be prepared for the different way people will react to situations. At the same time, take advantage of the commonalities between the different ethnic groups.</p> <p>South Africans have a common goal: securing the long-term future for their country. Anybody who can assist them in this will be welcomed into the business community. Enter into ventures with a long-term view, and do not push for a quick return. Bear in mind the Department of Trade and Industry's Black Economic Empowerment initiative (BEE) in all your business dealings (a socioeconomic strategy to increase black ownership and management of businesses and ensure equal representation in the workplace). Invest in training and knowledge-sharing if you are managing a multicultural team.</p> <p>Also bear in mind the South African approach to time managements, which, again, varies between different cultural groups. Generally speaking, though, there is not the same sense of urgency as American managers may be used to. There is also an inherent desire to please, which means making promises that may not be possible to keep.</p>"
