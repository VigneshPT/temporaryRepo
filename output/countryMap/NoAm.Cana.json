They are traditional in their thinking and habits, modest and low key in attitude but enjoy a good sense of humour. They pride themselves on being honest and direct and are not given to prevarication or displays of rhetoric or emotion. With one of the most multicultural societies in the world, Canadians are tolerant and egalitarian in outlook. Despite their innate conservatism, they are also very progressive on some controversial social issues. Although they enjoy the trappings of success, Canadians are not ostentatious by nature.</p> <p>Canadians are sensitive about being taken for Americans. While enjoying a warm relationship with their neighbour, with whom they share a vast boundary and vigorous trade links, they are proud of the differences between the two countries and their peoples. They are often more subdued and measured than Americans. </p> <p>The majority of Canada is English-speaking although in the eastern part of the country, French is widespread and the fracophone Quebec at times threatens to secede from the confederation. A new awareness has arisen in recent years of the rights and traditions of the Aboriginal people and the discrimination and disadvantages they have suffered. </p> <p>Canadians are a peace-loving people and have generously committed personnel to serve with UN peacekeeping forces worldwide. A love of sports is endemic and though Canadians are hard working, their leisure time is greatly valued and is kept quite separate from the workplace. </p>"

      "body": " <p>Canada is one of the world's most multicultural societies, a fact of which its people are proud. Of a population estimated to be 32,270,507 in the third quarter of 2005, 28% were of British Isles origin, 23% of French origin, and people of other European descent made up 15% of the population. Amerindian was 2%, other origins including Arabic 6% and those of mixed origins, 26%. </p> <p><img height=\"182\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$NoAm.Cana.1;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Over 100 languages are spoken in the country and the many ethnic groups are well catered for in a range of multicultural newspapers, radio and television stations. </p> <p>Different from the American experience of a cultural \"melting pot,\" the Canadian experience is often referred to as a \"mosaic.\" In Canada, people of different cultures and customs live together within a larger society that generally accepts and encourages degrees of difference. Formal and informal efforts are made within society to both allow for, and benefit from, these differences. In principle, people are united as citizens sharing a common identity as Canadians, while maintaining and celebrating their distinctions.</p> <p>Canadians are open and tolerant. There has however, been long standing unrest with radical elements in Quebec lobbying for independence which erupted especially badly in 1970. A referendum in 1980 soundly rejected the idea of an independent Quebec but a second referendum in 1995 was a much closer contest with the Quebecois deciding by a very thin majority to stay within Canada. The debate continues and may do so for some time. </p> <p>A typical Canadian family consists of 2 parents and 1.6 children. Often, both parents work. Yet the number of traditional families is lessening - it now stands at around 44% - and there is a rise in single parent families. Same sex marriage was legalized in 2003 in some provinces and territories. A high proportion of couples now live together without marrying. </p> <p>There is a very high level of tertiary education in Canada and it consequently has one of the most educated societies in the world. With its very high taxation rates, however, Canada loses a fair share of its educated workforce to its neighbour, the United States, and to other countries. </p> <p>Canada has a population density only slightly higher than Australia but it is a highly urbanized society with about 80% of its population living in towns and cities. More than 90% of the population lives within 160 km of the border with the United States and over half the population lives in the eastern provinces of Ontario and Quebec. </p> <p>Canada has two official languages - English and French. French is not as prevalent in the west of the country while English is hard to find in Quebec. Many immigrants living in Canada still speak their mother tongue. </p>"

Canadians enjoy affluent living standards and the country ranks sixth in the world in standard of living measured according to gross domestic profit per capita, and is rated higher in this list when measured along with other factors like life expectancy and education which contribute to quality of life. Basic health care (except for dental care) is free. Canada has a broad social security network, which includes old age pensions, a family allowance, unemployment insurance and welfare. </p> <p><img height=\"133\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$NoAm.Cana.2;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Canadians households are well-stocked with the latest electronic equipment and other luxuries familiar in Western economies. Standards of living are, however, more modest than in the United States due to lower incomes and high rates of taxation. Many Canadians leave Canada to work in the United States to seek greater earnings and career advancement. Canadians work fewer weeks per annum than Americans. Outdoor pursuits are popular on weekends and on holidays. Many children spend some weeks a year of their summer break in camp. </p> <p>Despite the national love of sports and the great outdoors, obesity is a serious health issue in Canada. </p> <p>Canadians are great sports fans. The most famed national game is hockey (called simply hockey, not ice hockey) which is played with gusto. From September to June the nation is transfixed by the sport and the Canadian team regularly win medals at the Olympics. Lacrosse is also a national passion. Other sports include a Canadian version of American football, curling, skiing, cycling, hiking and fishing. </p> <p>The Canadian Aboriginal populations, like many elsewhere, suffered centuries of mistreatment which has been addressed in more recent times through legislation. However, many Aboriginal people are still disadvantaged in comparison to other Canadians. Large numbers have fled to the cities and live in underprivileged conditions. Suicide rates are higher than average in this group and their life expectancy is lower. </p>"

A knowledge of Canada, its history and traditions will make a good impression as Canadians are well-educated and have a high level of world awareness.

Be prepared to have any material which needs to be in French translated and to have an interpreter booked if one is needed. It is best to check this in advance. Have material and data needed for a meeting prepared, too - Canadians are objective and analytical and will expect business associates to be well organised. Be clear as to what the goal of the meeting is and go into the meeting with a view to setting an action plan.</p> <p><b>During a meeting</b></p> <p><img height=\"133\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$NoAm.Cana.7;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Canadians are open and hospitable, and meetings may begin with an exchange of pleasantries, although very personal subjects should be avoided unless the participants know each other well. After that, expect negotiations and meetings to be dealt with efficiently and with reasonable dispatch. It is not unusual for those making pitches to be asked questions from all members of a management team - old or young. In common with Canada's spirit of egalitarianism, one person may be substituted for another in discussions in meetings. Although Canadians are relaxed and calm in manner, they are traditional in their values and appreciate attentive and considerate behaviour. Avoid making calls on mobile phones or otherwise interrupting meetings unless you have indicated, for instance, that you may have to take an urgent call. </p> <p><b>Following a Meeting</b></p> <p>There is no need to end discussions abruptly after meetings have ended. Be prepared to stay a while afterwards to demonstrate that the business - and the relationship - is important to you. Follow up any matters which need to be dealt with promptly and do not exert undue pressure for any decisions; although efficient, Canadians will have to confer and give due consideration to company policy. </p> <p>When a meeting is over, set an action plan and circulate it to all attendees.</p>"

Overseas travel and outward-bound challenges or wilderness retreats for <img height=\"150\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$NoAm.Cana.8;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">bonding are both popular. Incentive schemes for clients and suppliers are popular, too.</p> <p>But motivating a Canadian team is more complex than this. Canadians are encouraged by a good quality of life.
