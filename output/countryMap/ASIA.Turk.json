The east is more adherent to Islam than the west, where cities like Istanbul and Ankara are big, urban sprawls with all the trappings of modern life and the cultural values to match.</p> <p>Turks are proud of their democracy and their progress and are keen to shake off their cultural stereotypes (belly dancers, women in headscarves, the strong military) and are hurt by the opponents to their country&#039;s accession to the European Union, particular by the view that membership will lead to a flood of unwelcome Turkish immigrants to the richer, north European countries.</p> <p>Government and religion are separate issues in the modern Turkey but Islamic culture does continue to influence daily life, beliefs, language, teaching, social relationships and democracy. It impacts all levels of society, providing guidance, values, and rules for personal life, public behaviour and ways of doing business.</p>"

      "body": " <p>In urban areas, Turks live a Western lifestyle, frequenting bars and clubs, shopping for high fashion, buying cars, enjoying festivals and taking weekend breaks. Holiday resorts are strung along the Aegean coast and domestic travel is popular.</p> <p><img border=\"1\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Turk.2;0.jpg\">Rural areas are considerably more conservative. More people follow Islam and life revolves (for men) around the mosque. Alcohol is less visible.</p> <p>There is an element of tradition in daily life, too, which may seem clich&eacute;d but is true. Turks enjoy relaxing with a cup of thick Turkish coffee; men will smoke from a <em>nargileh</em> (a water pipe) in their favourite cafe (and visitors may be invited to join in) and Turks will visit the local <em>hammam</em> (steam bath), which always has separate sections for men and women. All of these activities can be highly enjoyable for visitors.</p> <p>Another activity that unites all Turks is football. Most Turkish men love football and usually support one of the three big teams, Galatasaray, Besiktas or Fenerbah&ccedil;e. Asking after their team&#039;s recent fortunes will always produce lively and animated responses.</p> <p>Turks are also highly political. Everybody knows how much the coveted EU membership will change everyday life (mainly for the better) but raising the thorny subject of Cyprus can be problematic, particularly as most visitors do not understand the real depth of the issue. According to the latest 2009 surveys, 57% of the Turkish population are in favour of EU membership despite some groups (e.g 16-18 yr olds) having suspicions over the EU intentions towards Turkey.</p>"

At social occasions, greet the person closest to you, then work your way around the room or table anti-clockwise. </li> <li>Greet people with either the Islamic greeting of &#039;Asalamu alaykum&#039; [peace be upon you] or &#039;Nasilsiniz&#039; [How are you? Pronounced na-sul-su-nuz] Other useful phrases are &#039;Gunaydin&#039; [Good Morning, pronounced goon-ay-dun], &#039;iyi gunler&#039; [Good Day, pronounced ee-yee gun-ler] or &#039;Memnun Oldum&#039; [pleased to meet you]. </li> <li>Although a law was passed banning smoking in offices, very few comply with the regulations. Most Turks smoke, which some foreigners find offensive. If smoking during a meal bothers you, suggest an outdoor restaurant.</li> <li>The Turkish gestures for &#039;yes&#039; and &#039;no&#039; can at first be quite confusing. &#039;Yes&#039; is indicated with a nod of the head upwards, while &#039;no&#039; is also an upward nod but accompanied by the raising of the eyebrows. A sure sign that a &#039;no&#039; is meant is if it is accompanied with a hissing of the teeth [&#039;tsk&#039;]. </li> <li>Turks are very politically-aware and like a good debate, but be careful when discussing Cyprus or the Kurdish situation. </li> <li>Turkish people are also very aware of foreign politics, being situated as they are between Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia. Do not be surprised to find your Turkish friends highly informed on world events.</li> <li>Many Turks will identify themselves as Muslim but will not necessarily practice. Some will drink alcohol but eating pork is extremely unusual.</li> <li>Status is important and you will be judged on your family (if you are Turkish), your profession and your appearance (if you are foreign). Gadgets like a state-of-the-art mobile phone are popular.</li> <li>Bargaining is part of everyday life and will occur at all levels.</li></ol> </p><p></p>"

      "body": " <p>The key to success when working with Turks is relationship-building. This is absolutely essential and the first meeting at least should be devoted to it. Turks will not do business with someone who expects to work only by phone and email, which is why several visits, or better still, a local office, are essential.</p> <p>Working with Turks is highly rewarding. They are keen entrepreneurs and are eager to progress. The workforce is <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Turk.4;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">young, multi-lingual and highly educated and competition for jobs is strong. The currency has stabilised and the economy is improving. Turkey&#039;s desire for EU accession underpins most activity.</p> <p>Observance of etiquette is important. Turks are Muslims living in the most secular of states but Islam still influences their culture, three of its characteristics being hospitality, politeness and honour. Working with Turks means forging deep relationships, a great deal of entertaining and being entertained, and forming friendships that will last. Honour must not be betrayed. Turks also have a strong sense of saving face, which should be considered at all times. They are highly conscious of status and seniority, so bear this in mind when sending a negotiating team. Coming from a bargaining culture many centuries old, Turks make formidable negotiating opponents.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Learn about Islam and respect its cultural values. Your Turkish counterpart may be secular but Islam still influences everyday life.</p> <p>Dress respectfully. Men should wear smart suits and ties and women can dress in designer clothes if they wish but should avoid short skirts and plunging necklines.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Turk.5;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">DO try to greet your Turkish counterparts with an appropriate Islamic greeting. For example, &#039;Asalamu alaykum&#039; (peace be upon you). You would not be expected to use it but if you did you would receive the reply &#039;Wa alaykum salam&#039; (and peace be with you). </p> <p>Show respect for older people, who are considered wise.</p> <p>Remember to shake hands with everybody present at a meeting or social gathering and make plenty of time for small talk.</p> <p>Expect your counterpart to ask you a lot of personal questions, but keep your own questions general until the relationship is established.</p> <p>Turks enjoy political debate and are quick to discuss the ineptitude of their own politicians. It is, however, inappropriate for visitors to jump straight in with criticism; listen and learn instead. Remember that the Cyprus issue is extremely sensitive.</p> <p>Don&#039;t complain or wave your hand in front of your face if your Turkish friends and colleagues smoke around you. Smoking is endemic here and Turks will simply not understand your displeasure. It will also make them feel uncomfortable. If smoke causes you problems, make light of it and ask if you can dine outdoors.</p>"

      "body": " <p><strong>Business Cards</strong></p> <p><img style=\"margin-left: 10px\" alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Turk.6;0.jpg\" align=\"right\" border=\"1\">Business cards are widely exchanged; in a meeting, you will be expected to hand one to everybody present, so take a large supply. There is no special need to have them translated into Turkish. Make sure a card clearly shows your profession and rank; Turkish business is hierarchical and your counterpart will need to put you in context.</p> <p><strong>Body Language</strong></p> <p>Turks have a smaller requirement of personal space than most Europeans and Americans and will often stand close when talking, often grabbing someone&#039;s arm for emphasis and looking them direct in the eye, although the devout are less likely to use such an intense gaze. Eye contact is, however, a sign of sincerity; just watch the body language of the traders in the markets - their gaze never falters. </p> <p>Other body language is subtle and differs from what Americans and other Europeans may be used to. \"Yes\" is a slight downward nod of the head. \"No\" is a slight upward nod of the head while making a quick, sucking sound through your two front teeth (like \"tsk\"). It is considered rude to point your foot at somebody.</p> <p>Do not stand with your hands on your hips when talking to others, especially older people or superiors, or put your hands in your pockets. Also remember that putting your thumb between your first two fingers is the equivalent to raising your middle finger in the United States. </p> <p><strong>Communication Style</strong></p> <p>Turks use implicit, indirect communication and there is often a feeling, particularly in negotiations, that they are withholding something. They are likely to tell you what they think you want to hear and may find it difficult to say a direct &#039;no&#039;. They are also extremely tough negotiators, coming from a bargaining culture.</p> <p><strong>Gift Giving</strong></p> <p>Relationship building will usually take the form of dining or sight seeing trips rather than lavish gifts. It is not necessary to take a gift in a business setting, although a small memento of your company is acceptable. Never give alcohol unless you know the person well and you know that they would appreciate it; it&#039;s risky if you don&#039;t know them as they may be a practicing Muslim. When invited to a home, take a plate of Turkish pastries, or flowers or chocolates for the host. You can take candy for a host&#039;s children, too.</p> "

      "body": " <p><strong>Planning a meeting</strong></p> <p>Punctuality is important so try to aim for the meeting to start on time. If your Turkish counterparts are religious, you will need to plan a meeting around the five daily prayer times. <img border=\"1\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" width=\"200\" height=\"148\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Turk.7;0.jpg\">Turks work hard and do not like to be kept waiting. Remember that small talk is important before the meeting starts and you should shake hands with everybody present.</p> <p>Do not be surprised if your initial meeting is with a middle manager. These often act as gatekeepers to the senior levels of management and it is their duty to assess you and establish whether you are trustworthy and a good potential business partner.</p> <p>Ensure that you have a plentiful supply of business cards.</p> <p><strong>During the meeting</strong></p> <p>Shake hands with everybody at the meeting, starting with the most senior or if in doubt, the oldest. Offer your business card to everybody present. Simply nodding or waving at people is considered rude.</p> <p>Offer your guests tea (black with sugar), Turkish coffee or Nescafe (a generic term for instant coffee). Apple tea can be refreshing but is seen more of something drunk by tourists.</p> <p>Any meeting is likely to be interrupted by phone calls and other visitors and foreign visitors must be patient. Turks are naturally hospitable and find it hard to say &#039;no&#039; or turn people away. They also have a sense of wanting to deal with an issue there and then; Turks are polychronic, which means they will try to deal with multiple issues simultaneously.</p> <p>You can bring an agenda to a meeting but a meeting is seen as a forum for discussion and negotiation (or in the beginning, as a getting-to-know-you exercise) and the discussion can easily&nbsp;move away from the plan. Turks are, however, good listeners and therefore it is unusual for everybody to talk over one another.</p> <p><strong>After the meeting</strong></p> <p>Coffee and Turkish delight may be served and more time made for small talk. It is important to shake hands with everybody present once again before leaving. Agreements will be put in writing; the days of the deal sealed by a handshake are over. It is acceptable to circulate minutes of what was discussed, too.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Turkey is in a somewhat unstable state, with high unemployment, questions over EU membership, a feeling of slight rejection by some West European countries and the ongoing situation in neighbouring Iraq. It is therefore only natural that a sense of stability and permanence in the workplace acts as a motivator. Employees like to feel that they belong and are valued.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Turk.8;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Turks are also motivated by money and like to have Western-style gadgets, like the latest mobile phone or a good car. They also have a strong concept of work-life balance and will not work overtime unless they really have to. Annual leave entitlement is fairly generous and increases with years of service - but it is not uncommon for employees to take &#039;sick leave&#039; from time to time, whether or not they are sick.</p> <p>Typical packages might include, at senior level, perks such as a car, profit-share, share options, private medical insurance, relocation expenses and accommodation (for expatriates) and pension allowance.</p> <p>Team building events and company incentive schemes are not especially popular, although multinational companies often incorporate these. </p>"

      "body": " <p>Turks are keen to work with foreign investors and will normally listen attentively to a presentation, in their own way. Base the presentation on your personal relationship and what you can do for one another rather than on instant profit. Always emphasise the long term; Turks like money but generally the relationship is more important than the deal. Turks like change that leads to progress but are generally risk-averse. Turks are primarily oral and visual communicators, so in addition to written statistics, projections and the like, try to present information vocally or with maps, graphs and charts.</p> <p>Age is equated with wisdom and seniority is highly respected, so have a senior person speak if possible.</p> <p>Do not give away too much initially; remember that negotiating is a long, drawn out (and to a Turk, enjoyable) process and you need to keep something back for making concessions later.</p> <p>Do not be offended if your audience talks, smokes and uses mobile phones during your presentation. This is not a sign that they are bored or do not understand; it is simply the way people manage their time.</p> <p>Give the audience plenty of time to ask questions at the end of the presentation. Individuals may want time alone with a speaker if they have not understood something. Admitting this in front of colleagues may cause a loss of face. Handouts can be made available in English and Turkish.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Relationships are important to Turks and go very deep. Once someone is your friend, they will always be your friend. Friendship is not casual; friends are expected to do favours for one another and if you fail to understand this, your <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Turk.10;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Turkish friend may feel let down by you. Conversely, foreign visitors may feel that the friendship is too intense, and too much is expected of them.</p> <p>It is important that foreign visitors understand Turkish communication style and body language. In Turkish society, communication style is more indirect and gentle than direct. Soccer, fashion, food, the economy, and inept politics are among the favorite topics for most Turks, although you as a visitor should not comment on Turkish politics unless you know what you are talking about. Saving face is important and is the reason many Turks find it difficult to say &#039;no&#039; outright. Learn to read between the lines. Managing a team requires a strong, paternalistic or maternalistic character who is able to delegate responsibility but will steer the team and take overall responsibility. Managing customers and suppliers requires a great deal of relationship-building and frequent visits to Turkey.</p>"
