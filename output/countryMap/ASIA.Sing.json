The modern founding father of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew has always maintained hard work and meritocracy based on individual efforts and ensured individual recognition. Although many who enjoyed these 'merits' in the past were Chinese, nowadays, more and more Malays and Indians are being recruited and recognised.</p> <p>Singapore is a country filled with Eastern tradition with Western practice, which makes it difficult to generalise about the ethics of the various ethnic groups. Traditional Confucian ethics cannot, for example, always be applied to Chinese Singaporeans. Even the new generation Malays and Indians are quite different from their counterparts from Malaysia and India respectively. Although each group works hard to maintain its cultural traditions while building a modern cohesive society, Singaporeans of younger generation think of themselves as Singaporean first, and as Chinese, Malay or Indian second.</p>"

Singaporeans, despite their <img height=\"135\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Sing.1;0.jpg\" width=\"180\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">seemingly western lifestyle, see themselves as essentially Asian. The government even emphasises 'core values' to be embraced by Singaporean nationals, to help stop any drift towards the 'superficial' Western ideologies. These include emphasising community over self, valuing the family, resolving issues through the search for consensus rather than contention, and promoting racial and religious tolerance.</p> <p>Singapore is a multi-racial society, but while it is Chinese-dominated, Singapore is not a 'Chinese' society. Ethnic boundaries are beginning to blur as the country matures and new generations grow up. There is a sizeable expatriate population of Americans, British, Australians and New Zealanders. Racial discrimination is a serious offence in Singapore.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Singapore is very much a hybrid culture, where individuals are compelled to be 'culturally correct' in a family setting while being very much western-orientated in a business setting. Many examples can be seen of Chinese <img height=\"180\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Sing.4;0.jpg\" width=\"135\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Singaporeans failing as much as Westerners do in China and Indians generally not being able to crack into Indian businesses and Malays are not considered as 'proper' Muslims in Malaysia or Indonesia. A recent study has found more western-based concepts in doing businesses in Singapore than any other Asian country. Having said this, the Chinese concept of 'saving face' is deeply ingrained and should never be discounted. So while you should not assume that a Chinese Singaporean is like a Chinese person from the People's Republic, never assume that Singaporeans have purely Western ideals. They are uniquely Singaporean.</p> <p>When working in Singapore, understand the meaning of implicit communication and the value of politeness and formality. Learn to build personal relationships in business, which will take time, as will negotiations and decision-making. Expect to work with multicultural teams, where strong leadership and direction is required.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Although Singapore may appear to be westernised, Asian etiquette tends to apply in many situations, where considerable courtesy is expected. Handshakes (softer and longer than in the West) are followed immediately by a swap of business cards. The more forceful Western style is often perceived as rude. Singaporeans prize the appearance of seriousness and modesty, playing down successes and achievements.</p> <p><b>Business cards</b></p> <p><img height=\"135\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Sing.6;0.jpg\" width=\"180\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">The exchange of business cards is important and formal. Present your card with both hands and bow slightly as you hand it to someone. Accept their card with both hands, too. During a meeting, have the other person's card face upward on the table beside you. Having cards translated into Chinese is not essential but can be helpful. Use a title like Doctor or Professor on your card.</p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>Singaporeans are not particularly tactile, whatever their ethnic origin. Apart from shaking hands, there is very little physical contact in public. A comfortable distance from somebody else is two or three feet.</p> <p>Maintaining steady eye contact may be perceived as aggressive. Make brief eye contact when you greet someone and then let your gaze drop. Do not show the soles of your feet; sitting with one foot resting on the other knee is considered rude. Sucking in air through your teeth is a way of saying a firm 'no' or expressing that there is a problem.</p> <p>Do not make vivid facial expressions, like frowning or raising eyebrows. Keep your feelings to yourself. When sitting in a chair, keep your feet flat on the floor, rather than crossing your legs in front of elders or hierarchical superiors. Pointing is considered rude, as is extending a hand for a handshake with the palm facing down.</p> <p>Among Malay and Indian people, it's taboo to give or receive something with the left hand. The left hand is considered unclean as they use it for personal hygiene. It's impolite to point at a person with the forefinger. Instead, use the whole open right hand or use the thumb of the right hand with the other fingers closed into a fist. Never touch the head of a Malay as the head is considered the home of the soul and that is too sacred to touch. Always remove your shoes when you enter a person's home but remember that feet, as such, are considered unclean and should therefore not be casually displayed. Never point your feet at another person. When you sit on the floor, you should sit crossed-legged. Women should sit with the legs tucked under them, out of sight.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Business meetings are a complex and formal exchange of views based on implicit conversation, wily negotiating and the underlying concept of face, <i>mianzi</i> in Chinese. Having face means having high status in the eyes of one's peers, and it is a mask of personal dignity. Chinese are actually sensitive to having and maintaining face in all aspects of <img height=\"140\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Sing.7;0.jpg\" width=\"210\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">social and business life, including around the meeting table. Be aware of this when trying to solve problems of any nature.</p> <p>Several meetings will be required before any deal is struck as building trust and personal relationships is important. Singaporeans will take their time coming to a decision and you are expected to be patient. While a meeting may follow a strict agenda and be a formal affair with a large team present from either side, it will not necessarily have an immediate outcome.</p> <p><b>Planning a Meeting</b></p> <p>An agent may be a useful introduction if you have not done business in Singapore before or are looking to make new contacts. Using a third party is perfectly acceptable. Always be punctual for an appointment. Lateness is considered extremely rude (although a Singaporean may well turn up late). Schedule appointments at least two weeks in advance and reconfirm the day before.</p> <p>Singaporeans are highly organised and like to be prepared, so send as much information about yourself and your company before the meeting. Also supply your Singaporean counterparts with a list of your team members' names, in order of seniority, and their expertise. Expect the meeting to be formal and to follow a set agenda.</p> <p><b>During a Meeting</b></p> <p>It is polite to let your Singaporean counterparts establish who's who in a meeting, so it is normal to let the most senior member of your delegation enter the room first, followed by the second in command and so on. The Singaporean team will sit facing the visiting party, with persons of equal rank sitting opposite each other.</p> <p>The table is usually rectangular, and teams sit opposite each other with the heads of delegations sitting eye to eye. Other team members are arranged next to delegation heads, often in descending order of importance. It is normal to get down to business quickly, although discussion may be cyclical, rather than linear. Subjects you may consider closed could reappear throughout the discussion.</p> <p>Any material you distribute should be of top quality. Singapore is a high-tech society and tatty photocopies reflect badly on your company. Saving face is crucial to Singaporeans. In a meeting, avoid showing extremes of emotion or challenging someone in such a way that they will lose face.</p> <p>If you ask someone a question and they pause before answering, it shows that they are considering the question and their answer. You should adopt a similar practice, so your counterpart knows you have thought your answer through carefully. If you have something important to say, say it to the most senior person at the meeting.</p> <p><b>Following a Meeting</b></p> <p>A strong emphasis is placed on price, quality and service in Singapore so make sure your service - your follow-up, in other words - is good. You may be invited out to lunch or dinner after a meeting where you can continue to forge bonds of friendship with your Singaporean hosts. Major deals may require some government intervention, so do not expect immediate results. A written contract may not be final. Rather, it is a guideline for further negotiation.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Company loyalty is especially strong among Singaporean employees. Professional competence, merit, and the ability to work within a team are heavily emphasised. Respect for elders is ingrained in all Asian societies and this may override any other consideration when doing business, making decisions and working as a team.</p> <p>Ultimately, however, money, status and security motivate Singaporean workers just as they do other cultures. Singaporean business culture is intensely competitive and people work very hard, although they are driven probably more by the desire to succeed than actual work ethic. Getting Singaporeans to buy into a project emotionally is a strong motivator, particularly if they get to share the rewards. Wage increases are expected to be linked to productivity increases and many companies operate profit-share schemes.</p> <p>Typical employee benefits other than cash include insurance, medical expenses, car parking, country club membership, child daycare and even more esoteric subjects like consultation fees for Chinese medicine and medical expenses for elderly relatives.</p>"

From a Singaporean perspective, community is more important than 'self'. Make it clear that you appreciate Singapore's success and achievements and are keen to do business. Have high quality handouts to back up your presentation.</p> <p><b>Audience Expectations</b></p> <p>It is unlikely that you will be interrupted during your talk but you should invite questions afterwards. If questions are not forthcoming in a public forum, do not assume that there are none. Often following presentations Singaporeans will be interested in discussing issues on a one-to-one basis. Do not expect an instant or effusive reaction to your presentation. Public displays of emotion equate to a loss of face in Singapore.</p>"

Provided your follow up and customer service are good and results are generated, Singaporeans will be loyal to their overseas partners.</p> <p>Relationships in the workplace tend to be hierarchical and formal. Structures are respected, company loyalty is strong and leaders are respected and treated deferentially.</p> <p>As with any other aspect of Singaporean life, the cultural differences between the different ethnic groups need to be clearly understood in order to manage effectively. Storming in with a brash, Western style and trying to force change simply won't work.</p> <p>Singaporeans are accustomed to working in teams and work well together in mixed ethnic groups or in teams of the same ethnic group. There is an inherent trust between members of the same ethnic group. Strong leadership is needed, as are skilful delegation techniques, to get the best out of a Singaporean team.</p>"
