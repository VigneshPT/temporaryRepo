They enjoy a high quality of life, a generous welfare system and a high standard of education. Qualities attributable to many Dutch people include independence, self reliance, efficiency and thriftiness. There is a strong work ethic and a profit-orientated mentality.</p> <p>Anyone living in the Netherlands is used to life in a diverse, multiracial society, although the many different ethnic groups tend to co-exist, rather than integrate fully. </p> <p>Recently, there has been an increase in tension in The Netherlands, suggesting to many that multi-culturalism has gone too far. Gay anti-immigration campaigner Pim Fortuyn, who emerged as a dominant force in Dutch politics early in the 21st century, was assassinated in 2002 by an animal rights extremist. Two years later, outspoken filmmaker Theo van Gogh was shot and stabbed to death, with extreme Islamic quotations left pinned to his body. Anti-Islamic feeling is riding high, further stirred by the ongoing debate in the Dutch parliament about a proposed nationwide ban of the burqa, the traditional Islamic women's dress.</p>"

Over 40% of the population resides in the western provinces of North (Noord) Holland and South (Zuid) Holland and overall 89% of the population live in urban areas.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Neth.1;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">The people of the Netherlands commonly referred to as the Dutch, are descended from Germanic stock with some mixing form Gallo-Celtic stock. Of the 16 million plus population, 95% are ethnic Dutch with the remainder composed of Indonesians, (around 50,000), Surinamese (around 210,000) and approximately a quarter of a million 'guest workers', their families and descendants from Turkey and Morocco. Some 6% of the population are Muslims.</p> <p>The Netherlands has a very generous welfare system and a high standard of education. More than 20% of people have been to university. Despite the density of the population (the highest in Europe), the country is frequently voted in the top ten of desirable places to live in quality of life surveys.</p> <p>The Netherlands is well-known for its willingness to experiment and has an open-minded policy towards both soft drugs and prostitution, a fact which has brought the country perhaps more attention than it wants.</p>"

The two nations also share a love of gardening and flowers. Both also have a seafaring background, and a passion for the outdoors and the game of football.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Neth.2;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Dutch people spend much of their leisure time participating in games and sport, including football, cycling, swimming, golf and tennis. Sport is subsidised by the government and there are over 35,000 sports clubs. Special needs groups have their own sports clubs, too, such as the elderly or disabled, or long-term in capacitated. Football and ice skating are the two most popular sports, with hundreds of ice rinks, indoor and outdoor, for figure and speed skating, and hockey. In winter, it is possible to skate on the canals and lakes.</p> <p>There is a strong restaurant and caf&eacute; culture, with the variety of restaurants reflecting the diverse ethnic mix of the population.</p> <p>In the cities, there is a thriving cultural scene of opera, 1,200 museums, art galleries, theatres and concerts. </p> <p>Life in summer revolves around the outdoors, with picnics, cycle rides, walks, horse riding and street festivals taking place.</p> <p>Volunteer work is popular, especially among women.</p>"

Business negotiations proceed at a rapid pace, although paradoxically, in many companies, the decision-making process is slow, involving wide consultation. </li><li>Like the Germans, the Dutch are extremely punctual and make great use of their diaries.

Do not take this explicit approach as a 'shock-tactic' - the Dutch simply value candour and frankness. </li><li>Companies are frugal and careful with money.

Do not promise anything or make an offer you are not planning to deliver on. </li><li>The Dutch make a clear distinction between their personal and business lives. Think carefully before asking your Dutch colleague to stay late or work over the weekend. </li><li>Managerial qualities that are highly respected include firm leadership, open, honest communcation style and a willingness to listen to new ideas. </li><li>Do not call The Netherlands 'Holland' - Holland is a region of The Netherlands, not a country.</li></ol> </p><p></p>"

The Dutch are among the keenest members of the EU (despite having said no to its constitution in a recent referendum) and are genuinely international - well travelled, highly educated, multilingual. </p> <p>Honesty and openness are important qualities required to get along with the Dutch. They are partial to a good debate and will be direct to the point of bluntness. </p> <p>They are obsessed with timekeeping and hate to waste time, so lateness is not well regarded. Appointments must be made in advance, even something as simple as meeting for a drink after work.</p> <p>Modesty is important at all times and ostentatious dress, speech and mannerisms will be met with suspicion. This is an egalitarian society where the boss is on the same social footing as his or her employees. Structures within companies are flat and transparency is important. </p> <p>The Dutch are fairly risk-averse but are nonetheless entrepreneurial. They embrace new ideas, although expect them to be backed up with fact, and will always appear suspicious of change in the first instance. </p>"

You should also be prepared to engage in long debates and back up everything you say.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Neth.5;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">The Dutch are, despite their outspokenness, fairly shy and reserved and do not appreciate loud behaviour, close physical contact, constant touching during a conversation or exaggeration. Hard facts and a solid background will impress more than grandiose claims and plans. The same goes with your general demeanour. The Dutch can identify with frugality and are uncomfortable with lavish spending and ostentatious displays of wealth.</p> <p>Once you have reached agreement on a point, it is essential to keep your word and stick to the agreed deadline. </p> <p>Dutch people have a great respect for privacy. If you are new in The Netherlands, it's up to you to introduce yourself to people, and they will in turn introduce you to others. But you should set the social agenda, as the newcomer, or you will be left alone.</p> <p>Finally, never waste a Dutch person's time. Punctuality is essential at all times.</p>"

      "body": " <p><b>Business cards</b></p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Neth.6;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">It's unnecessary to have your business card translated, since most Dutch businesspeople are fluent in English. Promotional materials and instruction manuals, however, should be translated into Dutch, especially when dealing with complicated terminology. </p> <p>There is a strong respect for higher education in this country; so be sure to include any university degree above a B.A. on your business card. Do not confuse 'Drs.', which means a university graduate in the Netherlands, with 'Dr.', which signifies a Ph.D. </p> <p>There is no strict protocol regarding the exchange of business cards and they may not be exchanged until the end of a meeting. It is, however, OK to offer your card early on, particularly if you need to see your counterpart's card to remember their name, or figure out the Dutch pronunciation. Business cards are a useful way of ensuring that you are addressing your counterparts by their correct title. As a rule, do not use first names unless invited to do so. </p> <p><b>Gift giving</b></p> <p>Large, lavish gifts may be construed as a bribe and any ostentatious display is, in any case, frowned upon by the thrifty Dutch. It is acceptable to turn up with a small gift, though - something tasteful, branded, or a quality item bearing you company's logo.</p> <p>If you are invited to dinner at a Dutch person's home, take a bouquet of flowers or a box of Belgian chocolates. It's acceptable to bring wine but this may not be opened on this occasion.</p> <p>Birthdays are a big event in the Netherlands. If it is your birthday, you are expected to bring cakes to the office to share with your colleagues.</p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>Communication in the Netherlands is direct, to the point and open. This means that people can sometimes become frustrated when dealing with others whose communication style is very circular. </p> <p>The Dutch avoid superlatives. Compliments are offered sparingly, and to say that something is 'not bad' is to praise it. A person who never offers criticism is seen as either being simple-minded or failing to tell the truth. A foreigner need not worry too much about saying something that will hurt feelings. The Dutch will argue, but seldom take offence. </p> <p>The Dutch speak directly, often in short, to the point sentences, and use a lot of eye contact. To an outsider, they may appear abrupt but it is not intended to be personal. </p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>Body language is subdued and excessive physical contact is frowned upon. Dutch people may appear quite shy and reserved until you get to know them. Their humour is subtle rather than slapstick. </p> <p>Don't use wild gestures while talking or presenting, as it will distract your audience. Keep a good distance from the person you are speaking to and don't touch them unnecessarily, as it will make them uncomfortable. Avoid back slapping and big embraces. Eye contact is, however, important.</p>"

Be punctual - lateness is a cardinal sin and if you are running late, it is polite to phone with an excuse. Do not automatically assume that an appointment can be changed at the last minute.</p> <p>Send your promotional material, or an agenda for the meeting (if you have called it) ahead, so everybody can prepare. </p> <p><b>During a meeting</b></p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Neth.7;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Although everybody is expected to contribute to a meeting, time-wasting is frowned upon. Expect to get right down to business, with little small talk.</p> <p>Meetings should run efficiently and to a schedule. Stick to the agenda. But expect lengthy discussion while everybody has their say.</p> <p>Presentations should be short, concise, laden with facts and honest. Your audience should listen during the presentation and ask questions afterwards.</p> <p>Frank and direct exchanges are normal. If your proposal is going to be turned down, this is likely to happen on the spot. Similarly, now is the time to raise issues and objections, rather than stewing over a point and failing to voice your opinion.</p> <p><b>After a meeting</b></p> <p>Follow up immediately in writing to show your sincerity. Be sure to put everything in writing - Dutch executives are highly organised and efficient. Because many people are involved in the decision making process, any correspondence is likely to be viewed by a number of colleagues, so be wary of wording something in a jokey or over-familiar way.

Respect, tolerance, equality and an easy life are all important factors. Extreme <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Neth.8;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">wealth (or at least, the flaunting of it) is frowned upon and in any case, the Dutch already have one of the highest standards of living in the Western world. So there is not the struggle for self-improvement that you might find in, say, the USA. Dutch workers are more motivated by the desire to do a good job. Standards here are high and even the smallest business take pride in their products.</p> <p>Income tax is very high in the Netherlands - up to 60% - so many employees are motivated by bonuses, profit share, pensions, company cars and club memberships. Many companies, particularly large ones, operate employee incentive schemes, particularly in the field of sales, with travel and other rewards, often based on a team's, rather than an individual's performance. Off-site teambuilding exercises are often used.</p> <p>Dutch people in general are conscientious and loyal so they are also driven by internal recognition and by leaders who are seen to be instilling a relaxed, cooperative work environment. This also means a recognition of work-life balance as the Dutch believe strongly in the need to preserve family values over the stresses and strains of today's work ethic.</p>"

Don't make your presentation boastful and do not dwell <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Neth.9;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">on the success of your company for too long. Do not be subjective. Use facts instead to make your point. Having said this, a high-tech presentation will impress, provided it is of substance. You should certainly not rely on anything as antiquated as an overhead projector; the Dutch are highly computer-literate and expect PowerPoint at the very least.</p> <p>The presentation can be in English but avoid jargon and colloquial terms. Have good, clear visuals and translate technical areas into Dutch handouts, so everybody understands what you are saying. Keep the handouts for after the presentation, or you will lose the audience while you speak and they read.</p> <p>Dutch audiences are open to new ideas.

Highly taxed, they are also motivated by money, bonuses, extra holiday and other perks. Open competitiveness between individuals in the workplace is not especially encouraged, as this is contrary to the Dutch egalitarian society, but teams will compete against one another nonetheless.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Neth.10;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Dutch companies are generally very socially responsible and are highly advanced when it comes to looking after their employees and offering coaching and training, with numerous mentoring schemes and further education offered to workers. Sophisticated feedback techniques are used and employees expect to be able to offer feedback to their superiors, whether it is positive or negative. In all workplace situations, people are expected to put forward their point of view and should not be judged negatively just because they disagree with the group.</p> <p>Relationships with customers and suppliers should be handled in the same way as relationships in the workplace. Everybody should be treated with respect, and as an equal. Customers expect politeness but not obsequious service. Suppliers expect to be given deadlines and will meet them.</p>"
