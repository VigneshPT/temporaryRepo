Tradition and continuity have shaped modern Egypt, which was effectively isolated for centuries, surrounded by desert on three sides and the Mediterranean on the fourth.</p> <p>The family is the most important unit of society and kinship ties extend into the workplace and all other social transactions. Honour and respect are very important to Egyptians, who are polite, hospitable and deeply conservative, as well as being one of the most tolerant and open of the Arab nations.</p> <p>Most Egyptians are brought up to be associative thinkers: information is filtered through an experiential, subjective point of view. The main source of truth is faith in the Islamic ideology, modified by personal feelings.</p> "

      "body": " <p>Life in Egypt is and always has been dictated by the patterns of the River Nile. With so much of the country arid desert, civilisation has grown up along the river, with almost all of the 81 million people living along its banks or in its delta. Cairo alone has seven million inhabitants, making it the largest city in Africa, with a population density of 75,000 people per square mile. <img border=\"1\" align=\"left\" width=\"147\" height=\"220\" alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Egyp.1;0.jpg\">Otherwise, some 30% of the population are farmers, crammed into the tiny green strip of fertile land either side of the Nile. Those who are not farmers are likely to work in tourism and other service industries.</p> <p>Family ties are very important and although there is a strong chance that young people will leave for big cities like Cairo or Alexandria to study or seek work, they retain strong contacts with their families and roots. Young women will live at home until they marry. A dowry system still operates. Marriages are not, however, arranged except in the most conservative of families.</p> <p>Egyptians are extremely people-orientated and friendships and family will always come before business. They have a strong sense of honour and a deep sense of patriotism. They also have a deep-rooted sense of hospitality, which will be extended whether you are visiting a home to visiting a workplace.</p> <p>Social class is important to Egyptians and they place one another in the context of upper, middle or lower class. There is little social mobility between classes and membership of a group depends more on family ties and background than on actual wealth.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Egyptians work to live rather than living to work. Outside the workplace, the family is the single most important factor, with leisure time occupied by family meals, visits and outings. Eating out is popular, although men and women may dine separately. Networking in business circles is important, particularly for men.</p> <p><img border=\"1\" align=\"left\" width=\"154\" height=\"220\" alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Egyp.2;0.jpg\">Leisure activities include football, both playing and watching; belly dancing (women) and watching belly dancing (men and women); music; the arts, particularly in the big cities and some sports. Visits to the countryside are not really an option as city or riverbank rapidly turn to desert, but Egyptians will travel domestically to the antiquities of Upper Egypt (Luxor and Aswan) and to the Sinai peninsula and the Red Sea beaches. Most social activity for men, however, is visiting a cafe, smoking a water pipe, drinking coffee, playing backgammon and passing the time of day with other men. Women are more inclined to visit on another&#039;s houses, shop in the markets and spend time with their children.</p> <p>Young people, particularly in urban environments, are increasingly exposed to technology and enjoy computer games and internet surfing. Gadgets and designer clothing are considered prestigious.</p>"

It is absolutely essential to take the time to build a relationship with your Egyptian counterpart before trying to start negotiations.</li> <li>Family and kinship are very important to Egyptians. Nepotism is considered a positive and you&#039;ll often find several members of the same family at high levels within one company.</li> <li>Personal introductions are by far the best way to get to know Egyptians. Always engage a local representative to set up appointments and help you get a foot on the business ladder.</li> <li>Egyptians have very complex social networks and you&#039;ll often find one individual sitting on the board of or acting as consultant to several companies. This is why it is so important to cultivate personal relationships; you never know where a relationship may lead.</li> <li>Foreign women are generally treated with respect in Egypt and many Egyptian women hold high-ranking jobs, though still far fewer than men. It is, however, important to dress modestly and understand that you are operating within the limitations of a Muslim society.</li> <li>Business entertaining plays a very strong part in any deal. Egyptians are extremely hospitable, as are most Arabs, and it would be considered very rude to decline an invitation.</li> <li>Egyptians have a strong sense of honour and a man&#039;s word is his bond. They also have a strong sense of face and will go to great lengths to preserve this.</li> <li>Many Westerners working in Egypt have difficulty coping with the Egyptian concept of time. Meetings will start late and will often run over time, and it is considered rude to cut somebody off during a discussion just because another appointment is due. Deadlines may or may not be met; Egyptians believe that everything is ultimately the will of God.</li> <li>Egyptians are high context communicators and it is important to learn to read between the lines of what they are saying as well as to study their body language to find out what they really mean. Because saying &#039;no&#039; to somebody may cause them to lose face, Egyptians will go to great lengths to avoid giving a negative answer.</li> <li>Egypt is located in the very heart of the Middle East and although it has very strong ties with the West, is still essentially an Arab country and has a strong affinity with most of its neighbours. Discussing or criticising Egyptian politics and foreign policy is a bad idea.</li> </ol> </p><p></p>"

They take business personally and are <img border=\"1\" align=\"left\" width=\"200\" height=\"129\" alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Egyp.4;0.jpg\">keen to form relationships with overseas investors. Everything is relationship-based and once you have started working together, an Egyptian will see themselves as your friend. People perform favours from one another and have extended social networks, which is vital to getting on within the business community. Introductions are essential so always work with a local agent or fixer.</p> <p>The Egyptian concept of time can be frustrating to many Westerners or those unused to Arab culture. Learning to accept it is key to doing business successfully in Egypt.</p> <p>It is also important to understand Egyptian communication style. People may not always mean what they say and may not say what they mean. Egyptians have a strong sense of face, are risk averse and dislike confrontation.</p> <p>When working with Egyptians, entertainment is a vital part of doing business. On a visit to Egypt, you should bank on being entertained most evenings, with many late nights and a lot of talking. Invitations should always be reciprocated.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Egyptians have a completely different sense of time to Westerners and you will make a good impression if you learn to accept this rather than resisting it. Take time to build relationships and remember that trust and friendship must be established before any business can be done. Showing frustration during negotiations while trying to meet deadlines will get you nowhere.</p> <p><img border=\"1\" align=\"left\" width=\"200\" height=\"124\" alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Egyp.5;0.jpg\">Egyptians have a strong sense of humour which can be a great way of creating a bond. Sharing a joke is a good way to begin to forge a friendship. Friendships are long-lasting and once trust has been established it will be very difficult to break the link.</p> <p>Egyptians are also deeply conservative. It is important to dress and behave with respect, even when you feel you know somebody very well. Always use the correct form of greeting and a degree of formality in written communication.</p> <p>Like all Arabs, Egyptians are deeply hospitable, whether offering a guest coffee during a meeting or hosting a lavish banquet. Even if you are not hungry or thirsty, you should always accept hospitality as it is an insult to decline. Observe these rules of etiquette when reciprocating.</p> <p>Learn what is and what is not an acceptable topic of conversation. Be very careful not to ask personal questions about an Egyptian&#039;s wife or children, particularly girls; instead make a general enquiry about the welfare of the family. Do not be insulted if you are asked seemingly inappropriate questions like your age and how much you earn.</p>"

      "body": " <p><strong>Business cards</strong></p> <p>Have your business cards translated into Arabic before visiting Egypt. Be prepared to give away quite a few. When presented with an Egyptian&#039;s business card, take time to study it and make some comment about it simply to acknowledge the transaction. Either keep it on the desk beside you during the meeting or file it carefully into a suitable business card holder.</p> <p><strong>Communication style</strong></p> <p>Egypt is a high context culture which means that a lot what is communicated is transferred implicitly with body language, silence, eye contact, and oblique <img border=\"1\" align=\"left\" width=\"200\" height=\"123\" alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Egyp.6;0.jpg\">words or phrases. For example, it is considered impolite to deny a wish to someone. Instead of saying &quot;no&quot;, other phrases are used to describe an inconvenience, which implies that the answer is &#039;no&#039;. When an Egyptian says &quot;yes&quot;, he or she may actually mean &quot;possibly&quot;. Communication can include intense eye contact and frequent gestures for emphasis.</p> <p>Egyptians tend to be emotional and tend to use emphatic language; they also tend to exaggerate. When making a point they will speak loudly and repeat themselves for emphasis. They will frequently interrupt each other and will speak over other speakers. Egyptians love language and you can expect a lot of rhetoric that includes exaggeration, poetics, emotion, and flowery phrases.</p> <p>Be aware that Arabic is a language of hyperbole. For example, when an Egyptian says &quot;yes&quot;, he may actually mean &quot;possibly.&quot; Although you should feel encouraged by these positive responses, it would be wrong to assume that the negotiating is over.</p> <p><strong>Body language</strong></p> <p>Be very careful when using hand gestures as many that are familiar in the West are extremely rude in Egypt, such as the thumbs up sign. Never show the bottom of your shoes, which is considered an insult in the Muslim world. Be aware that the left hand is considered unclean and should not be used, particularly for eating or passing something to somebody. Keep steady eye contact when talking to a man and moderate eye contact when talking to an Egyptian woman.</p> <p>Be aware that Egyptians talk at a much closer distance than Westerners; do not back away if you think somebody is standing too close as this is simply their conversational style.</p> <p><strong>Gift-giving</strong></p> <p>Small gifts are often exchanged in Egypt. Something simple that reflects the culture of your country or your company would be appreciated and you are likely to receive a gift in return. Be very careful not to present anything that contains pork products or alcohol. Make sure that you present the gift with your right hand only. Do not confuse a small gift with a bribe.</p>"

      "body": " <p><strong>Planning a Meeting</strong></p> <p>Despite the fact that Egyptian timekeeping appears extremely lax, business meetings are fairly formal. Make an appointment through your Egyptian go-between and either telephone to <img border=\"1\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Egyp.7;0.jpg\">reconfirm it or send somebody with a message. Although an agenda is unlikely to be adhered to, you can still send one in advance and let your Egyptian counterpart know how many people will be attending the meeting so they can be prepared. If you&#039;re using a local agent or representative, it is appropriate to bring them to the meeting. You can even have your agent meet the person in advance to set the scene of what you hope to discuss. This person can also act as an interpreter during the meeting if necessary.</p> <p><strong>During the Meeting</strong></p> <p>All meetings begin with tea and coffee and small talk, however limited the time. You must always accept the offer of a drink even if you don&#039;t want one as to decline is to insult your host.</p> <p>Meetings tend to be fairly chaotic. People will accept telephone calls on their mobile phones throughout and others may walk in and out of the room, irrespective of whether somebody is talking. An Egyptian may appear to be holding several meetings simultaneously. This is simply a cultural factor; try not to get frustrated by it. Do not expect to negotiate anything at the first meeting. Initial gatherings are simply to meet one another and begin to form a relationship.</p> <p><strong>After the Meeting</strong></p> <p>Follow-up after a meeting should be clear and specific. If you&#039;re planning to take things further, be sure to know who you will be dealing with and who makes the decisions. Send a polite follow-up letter or e-mail thanking the Egyptian team for their time and clarifying exactly what should happen next. An Egyptian&#039;s word is allegedly his or her bond but things can easily be forgotten or lost in the chaos.</p>"

They are family-orientated and risk-averse and will respond best to an environment where they feel valued and at home. This will encourage them to feel loyal to the company. Communication between managers and subordinates should <img border=\"1\" align=\"left\" width=\"148\" height=\"220\" alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Egyp.8;0.jpg\">be verbal wherever possible, not via memos. Feedback should be spontaneous, positive and encouraging and anything negative should be conveyed indirectly and discreetly.</p> <p>Egyptians are also motivated by prestige. A job with a multinational is considered prestigious, or a very high-ranking position in an Egyptian company. Nepotism is prevalent and promotion within a company may be a fairly subjective matter, which is considered a positive thing.</p> <p>Setting targets and deadlines will not motivate the fatalistic Egyptians, whose concept of time is completely different to that of Western cultures. People other than those at the top rarely put in overtime, allowing work to encroach on family time, and certainly not to meet some arbitrary deadline set by a guest worker. The future is subject to God&#039;s will and planning far ahead is not usually done.</p>"

Emphasise the personal - who runs the company, its history, how working together will benefit you and the Egyptians, who will work on the deal - and present clear statistics as well. Do not place too much emphasis on time and <img border=\"1\" align=\"left\" width=\"200\" height=\"119\" alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Egyp.9;0.jpg\">deadlines. Avoid the heavy sell, which will put Egyptians off. Use humour if it translates across borders but keep it simple - and sensitive to Egyptian culture. Avoid politics completely.</p> <p>If using an interpreter, remember to speak slowly and allow time for the interpreter to catch up. Make eye contact with the audience. Do not be put off by the fact that phones will ring during the presentation and that people will come and go.</p> <p>An audience expects the chance to answer questions and may well interrupt a less formal presentation. They need to put the speaker in context so remember to introduce yourself and provide background. An audience is likely to smoke throughout a presentation.</p>"

If you try to conduct a relationship by email, you may well find yourself replaced by someone who makes the effort to visit and indulge in small talk and entertaining.</p> <p>Once you have established your relationship with an Arab, they will be loyal to you and will consider you a friend. The relationship must not become too close or informal, which is a sign of a lack of respect, and <img border=\"1\" align=\"left\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Egyp.10;0.jpg\">protocol must always be observed, but it should be rewarding. Make a point of using humour with Egyptians, who place great value on jokes, provided they are not of a religious or sexual nature, or practical jokes.</p> <p>Give feedback very carefully. Formal, written systems of giving and receiving feedback are frowned upon - Arabs see them as cold and impersonal. Positive feedback is acceptable if it&#039;s spontaneous and distributed between a whole team. Negative feedback must be delivered tactfully, indirectly and in private. Remember that prestige and a sense of belonging are strong motivators to Arabs.</p> <p>Harmony in the workplace should always be encouraged; although a heated discussion in Arabic may sound like an argument, it is merely an exchange of views. Losing one&#039;s cool does not impress and causes a loss of face for all concerned.</p>"
