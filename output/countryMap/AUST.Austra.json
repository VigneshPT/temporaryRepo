They can also be challenging, strident and&nbsp;surprisingly direct. Conservative and traditional in many respects and valuing family life and close friendships, Australians are progressive and innovative in their business and social outlook and are also creative.</p> <p>Australians are immensely proud of their country and of building a vigorous, prosperous society in harsh conditions and in a short period of time. They are quick to defend it against criticism. Australians enjoy self-mockery and are given to friendly bantering. While Australians generally work hard, they also greatly value their leisure time. </p> <p>Though much of Australian society springs from the early Anglo-Irish foundations of its first white settlement, the influx of immigrants, first from Continental Europe after the Second World War, and more latterly from Asia and the Far East, have resulted in a rich cultural and ethnic mix. Diversity and further legal separation from the United Kingdom has resulted in a greater sense of self. </p> <p>Many of the stereotypes about Australians are well rooted in reality. There is a national obsession with sport and the notion of `mate ship' is still prevalent, which, while ostensibly tough, is also quite sentimental. Women until more recently have not enjoyed equal status and recognition in a society where the machismo ethos has prevailed. Australia's more recent appreciation of the culture of the Australian Aboriginal people has added to the allure and range of its attractions. </p>"

Moreover, much of its population is found in several coastal areas. Though it contains vast <img height=\"133\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$AUST.Austra.1;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">deserts of stark beauty, the majority of its population is centered in large cities. It is, in historical terms and real terms, a young country with the median age of the population being 36.56 years. </p> <p>Though Australia has had a history of less tolerant attitudes it is now an inclusive society and is proud of its distinctly multiracial character. People of Caucasian origins make up the majority of the population but those of Asian origins and extraction are increasing. Immigration has been heavy since the Second World War and with the discarding of the White Australia policy in the 1970s, immigrants have been drawn from a much greater variety of countries. The birth rate is low at 12.26 per 1000 births in 2005, and the population is ageing, a cause of concern as the workforce needs to be maintained.</p> <p>English is the main and the official language though over 200 languages are spoken in the country. There is no official religion but the predominant faith is Christian. </p>"

The whole population has access to improved drinking water sources and sanitation facilities. There are 2.5 doctors and 8.5 hospital beds per 1000 people.</p> <p>Australians relish the outdoor life and sport is a national obsession at all levels of society. Football (which comes in a variety of forms from Australian Rules to Rugby, rugby league and soccer), cricket, golf, netball, hockey and many other sports are all popular. </p> <p><img height=\"150\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$AUST.Austra.2;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Since the majority of the populations live along Australian's coastal regions, going to the beach is a much-loved ritual and board riding and diving are all popular. The high incidence of skin cancer in Australia has prompted a greater awareness of the need to wear sunscreen and visitors should not underestimate the strength of the sun. </p> <p>Film and theatre are also keenly appreciated and Australia has a thriving film industry, producing fine actors and directors.</p> <p>Socialising with friends and family, either at home or in restaurants, cafes, in parks and at the beach, are important aspects of life. Australians are known for their enthusiastic consumption of alcohol, which may exceed what some visitors are used to. Don't try to keep up if your normal intake is less than that of your hosts. </p> <p>Australians are usually keen to show off the natural and man-made attractions of their country; taking a cruise or for example, Sydney Harbour, or a visit to a beach or local beauty spot, are popular ways of entertaining visitors. Australians have a high level of home ownership and are proud of their homes. An affluent lifestyle is often more of a preoccupation than more ephemeral aspirations.</p> <p>Foreign travel is almost a rite of passage nowadays for young Australians, who 'do' Europe, Asia and to a lesser extent, North and South America between university and starting a job. Many choose to settle abroad.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Australia is physically remote from most places so doing business there can often involve substantial investments in time and money. Establishing good relationships will also be key, although Australia is a sophisticated, Western-style economy, which does not especially depend on personal connections or any kind of 'old boy' network. It has high levels of education, comprehensive laws, many professional and trade organisations and a largely merit-based corporate structure with little family influence in more substantial companies, so finding your way around markets is easier than it may be in other places. There is no need for a local 'fixer' although it never hurts to attend business-networking events.</p> <p><img height=\"147\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$AUST.Austra.4;0.jpg\" width=\"210\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Social interaction is based on personal rapport and respect. People are not as passionate as they may be in some Mediterranean or Latin American countries and to the unsuspecting visitor, Australians can seem surprisingly direct. If faced with behaviour which you believe is too direct or blunt, remain calm and rational. Australians however, predominantly enjoy establishing good personal working relations with others. In business they are usually analytical and objective in their assessments. </p> <p>While not snobbish or class-driven, Australians do admire material success. Though they appear to be casual, there are high levels of sophistication generally in the country and among business associates you are likely to find a keen appreciation of dress and other accoutrements of success. They greatly value openness and good humour in others and also respect honesty and dignity. Australians value their leisure time and time spent with family and friends but are usually very hospitable to business visitors. </p>"

      "body": " <p>Australians appreciate directness and like to settle things generally without undue ceremony. Personal trust and a belief in the character and ability of business associates are important aspects of gaining trust and confidence. They do not appreciate attempts to deliberately impress; their down-to-earth <img height=\"141\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$AUST.Austra.5;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">attitude will quickly root out anybody considered to be 'phoney'. Being self-assured and in command of the subject in hand however, will create respect. Confident presenting skills are a big asset, as is a direct, straightforward negotiating style and an ability to make decisions. Being a good listener is also a valued quality.</p> <p>Australians are naturally cynical, particularly around anybody who seems too good to be true. There is often an empathy with the underdog. Having said this, they will form a natural trust of someone they consider to be their equal - unless this person proves otherwise.</p> <p>Taking the trouble to become acquainted with local conditions and issues will help win approval and acceptance. An enthusiasm for Australia's vigour, the beauty of its landscape, the quality of its food and entertainment and its prowess in sport will be good topics of conversation. The Aboriginal people or any kind of racism or prejudice are subjects to avoid. Asking questions about Australia's history, recent events or its numerous attractions will be greeted with enthusiasm. </p>"

They should be printed in English and denote your job title. A flashy or pretentious card may be seen as an object of ridicule. There is no particular routine associated with the presentation of a card as there is in Asia; Asian visitors should not be offended if their card is apparently treated with disrespect. This is not intentional.</p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>Physical demonstrations of friendship between men are usual in some countries but they are not the norm in Australian macho society and are usually frowned upon. Physical demonstrations of friendship and affection towards women by men should be restrained and may, if the parties do not know each other well, be considered inappropriate. Australians are usually somewhat restrained in their use of physical gestures while talking and making presentations. Physical space during a conversation is important (perhaps a metaphor for the vast size of the country), as is eye contact. Not keeping someone's gaze may make you appear shifty and dishonest.</p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>The Australian style of communication is direct and open and Australians are normally quick to get to a point. This open style can at times be interpreted by others from more formal societies as being confrontational while others can find it refreshing. No harm is usually meant but small talk may be kept to a minimum. </p> <p>Australians, much like the British, use irony a lot, which can be difficult for some&nbsp; cultures to appreciate.</p> <p><b>Business gifts</b></p> <p>Australians normally do not present gifts in business situations but they will appreciate gifts that have special significance - for instance something related to the business at hand or something from a visitor's home country. Be very careful when importing foodstuff, as Australian customs are extremely strict.</p> <p>It is appropriate to arrive at a dinner party with flowers, chocolate or wine. Gifts may be presented to visitors by Australian hosts to celebrate a special occasion.</p>"

      "body": " <p><b>Planning a meeting</b></p> <p>Meetings should be planned well in advance if people of higher rank in an organisation are to be included, or when several people need to be present. It is advisable to start by scheduling a meeting with someone of similar rank in the organisation with which you are doing business, although senior executives are usually very accessible. Australians do not expect to send large delegations to initial meetings as, say, a Japanese company might.</p> <p><b>During the meeting</b></p> <p>Australians are forthright and direct and prefer to get down to business, although some pleasantries can be exchanged at the beginning of a meeting so that the atmosphere is relaxed and some personal bonds <img height=\"150\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$AUST.Austra.7;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">are established. Australians especially enjoy hearing any appreciative comments about their country. </p> <p>It is important to be well prepared with any financial or other material that is needed for a meeting. Australians appreciate conciseness and value a person's command of a subject. Avoid hype and showmanship when making a presentation.</p> <p>While they enjoy earnest debate, repeated interjections or interruptions will be frowned upon. Keep the use of mobile phones to a minimum unless calls are urgent. Don't be taken in by an Australian's apparently casual style during a meeting; they are still assessing you and your company, however relaxed they may seem.</p> <p>Meetings do not usually get heated - Australians negotiate with a win-win goal - but the famous forthright manner may come across as aggressive or confrontational. If an Australian disagrees with you, they will not usually hesitate to say so.</p> <p><b>After a meeting</b></p> <p>At the end of a meeting, sum up what has been agreed and what needs to be done. Prepare an action plan and circulate it. You are not expected to wait around at the end of a meeting to secure the deal with a drink or anything, although if invited, it is polite to accept.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Applying traditional models of motivation technique to Australians is difficult because Australia is such a multicultural society. What might motivate Asian workers in Sydney is very different to what would <img height=\"220\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$AUST.Austra.8;0.jpg\" width=\"148\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">inspire better productivity among a Greek team member in Melbourne. Understanding the cultural differences and dynamic within any given team is a good starting point.</p> <p>Generally speaking, Australians are motivated by the idea of a better quality of life as well as the idea of pure material gain. Part of this is job stability, and a sense of belonging, which is changing rapidly. Gone are the days when people took their job for granted; many companies only hire on a contract basis now, so security is a big concern.</p> <p>Recognition is very important. Australians generally have a strong, energetic work ethic and respond well to a positive environment. They are used to competitive situations - you only have to look at the country's obsession with sport to appreciate its love of team activity and winning. There is, particularly among Australian men, a desire to prove oneself. Tapping into this will get the best out of some team members. Australians also have a strong sense of fair play though, so any leagues or competitions set up as part of a motivation scheme must be carefully considered, so that everybody has an equal chance of winning.</p>"

      "title": "Effective Presentations",

      "body": " <p>It is important to establish a rapport with the audience. A short, personal and friendly introduction will be welcomed but not one which includes immodest pronouncements about qualifications and experience; if you do this, your Australian audience will probably not take you seriously. If you want to emphasise the success or achievements of a business or product, it is best to set them out objectively, without undue or lavish praise. </p> <p>Australians can distrust those who are shy or aloof or who appear vain in any way. If these are the impressions given, you can expect some caustic comments. A modest, positive and friendly manner and a good sense of humour will be appreciated. But do not use any <img height=\"133\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$AUST.Austra.9;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">humour that is directed against Australia or Australians. National sensitivities are marked. </p> <p>When using slides and PowerPoint presentations, speak with each display. Keep it brief, get to the point, and back everything up with facts and figures. Australians are analytical, objective thinkers. Be well prepared for questions and answer them simply and directly. Many Australians, particularly those in large organisations, will be time-conscious. In smaller cities or government organisations, things may be more relaxed but it is advisable to judge the mood of the audience. Australians are very direct, and if some comments and questions strike you as blunt, they may not be meant to be offensive. Take questions literally and answer them in good spirit. If you are not accustomed to irony, be ready for it, as questions and conversation may be peppered with ironic statements.</p> <p><b>Audience Expectations </b></p> <p>Australians will expect well prepared and informative presentations with a minimum of hype or 'puff'. If using written information, ensure that it is concise and well laid out. Australians will respond to presentations and arguments, which are supported by a good and relevant range of facts. They are objective and analytical and can be skeptical. A Q&amp;A session should be allowed for at the end of any presentation. Australians will not generally expect to interrupt during the talk itself, though.</p>"

      "title": "Managing Relationships",
      "id": 10,
      "body": " <p>The Australian work environment is fairly casual and for those in situ, managing relationships should not require huge amounts of effort and maintenance. There is no particular pressure to socialise with colleagues, although it is done, or to spend time networking, although many people do this for pleasure.</p> <p>Managing from afar is different. Despite the advantages of modern telecommunications, Australia can seem a long way away to Europeans and North Americans. While a considerable investment in time and money is involved, regular visits to Australia are advisable, or with virtual teams, a proper communication structure. The sheer distance and the time difference can make this difficult.</p> <p>Australians are enlightened and international in their approach to business management, but at times, those from abroad can provoke resentment, particularly if they demonstrate an imperious, high-handed attitude. Misunderstandings can also occur do to newcomers' lack of understanding and experience of local conditions. </p> <p>Anyone new to Australian business culture will find it not dissimilar to that of the UK or North America - a hard-working meritocracy with pressure to achieve short-term profits, long working hours and at senior level, a degree of stress in meeting targets. Executive coaching is common, as are modern motivation techniques, approaches to teamwork and methods used in delivering feedback.</p>"
