With four different language groups crammed into a very small space and a foreign population of 20%, it is easy to appreciate the level of diversity in this small Alpine nation.</p> <p>Whatever the Swiss say about themselves, they can be broadly categorised as having a strong work ethic, a degree of materialism, an enjoyment of order and a love of consensus. They also have, by any standards, an extremely good lifestyle, low unemployment and relatively few social problems compared to the rest of Europe.</p>"

      "body": " <p>In the middle of the last century, Switzerland was a poor, obscure country with inhospitable terrain and few exports. Today, it has the lowest inflation and unemployment rates of all industrialised countries, the highest income per capita, and the second lowest interest rates. The crime rate is among the lowest in the world.</p> <p>Switzerland has a low birth rate, an ageing population and a high proportion of foreign residents - around 20% of the total population of 7.4 <img height=\"157\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Swit.1;0.jpg\" width=\"165\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">million. A high proportion of people live in cities, a significant change from 100 years ago when Switzerland was mainly a rural community.</p> <p>Switzerland is divided into German, French and Italian-speaking communities in 26 cantons, all with characteristics similar, but not identical, to Germany, France and Italy. A small percentage of the population (1%) also speaks the ancient language of Romansch. German-speakers make up the biggest proportion of the population, at 65%. </p> <p>Most cantons were created with either a Protestant majority (like Geneva and Zurich) or a Catholic one (like Valais, Fribourg and Lucerne). Where two communities share the same territory, cantons are divided into half-cantons. For example, Basle City (Protestant) and Basle Country (Catholic). Mentalities vary greatly, according to factors such as religion, language and whether people live in town or the country. Thus, people from rural, Catholic, German- speaking cantons may have a very different mentality from those living in Geneva. </p> <p>Many people live in rented accommodation. Families are started relatively late. The traditional way of life is changing, and more women now work, although inequality is still a big issue and those who have children sometimes find it difficult to make progress in their career.</p> <p>The proportion of people working in industry has dropped from nearly half in the 1960s to around a quarter by the beginning of the 21st century. At the same time, the proportion employed in the service sector has risen from 39% to 71%.</p>"

      "body": " <p>The Swiss work hard and play hard, with great emphasis placed on work-life balance. Sport plays an important part in most people's lives. Skiing, snowboarding, ice skating and cross country skiing are all popular winter <img height=\"220\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Swit.2;0.jpg\" width=\"147\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">activities, with hiking the country's network of 50,000 footpaths keeps people busy and healthy in the summer months. There is also renewed interest in sailing, following the victory of the Swiss team in the last America's Cup, and many people living around the lakes will own a small boat.</p> <p>Outdoor pursuits aside, reading and spending time with friends and family always rate highly in lifestyle surveys. Playing a musical instrument is less popular, although many people sing in a local choir - M&auml;nnerchor or Jodlerclub (men's choir or yodelling club) in German-speaking Switzerland, mixed choirs in French-speaking Switzerland.</p> <p>Music&nbsp;festivals usually take place in the summer and attract people from all over the country. These range from the famous Montreux Jazz Festival, which attracts big names from all over the world, to the Lucerne Festival of classical music.</p> <p>The Swiss are also very proud of their wine, although very little of it is exported. Many enthusiasts produce their own from the family-owned vineyard; if you are invited to sample this, you should feel extremely honoured.</p>"

Time is very valuable to the Swiss. </li><li>In this highly regulated conservative business environment, there is a reluctance to take risks. Make sure you have comprehensive data and precedents to support any proposal you make which implies change or risk. </li><li>The Swiss have a reputation for getting the best deal out of opponents without appearing aggressive or demanding. Likewise you should avoid pressurizing them in negotiations. Instead emphasize the quality of your offer and stay calm and consistent. </li><li>Allow your Swiss counterparts to put you in context - who you've worked with in the past, who you know in Switzerland. </li><li>Be very respectful of Swiss adherence to rules and regulations. Never attempt to circumvent them. </li><li>Modesty and humility are important virtues and clarity is equated with sincerity. </li><li>Business is regarded with seriousness. Humour has no place in negotiations with the Swiss. Techniques to lighten the mood or 'break the ice' are fine but be careful these do not detract from the seriousness of why people are working together. Take a more formal line until relationships are established. </li><li>Speak quietly and without excessive emotion - being over-emotional is being out of control. </li><li>The Swiss strive hard to avoid open disagreements and conflict but if necessary will look at the implications for all parties involved. You should respect this group sensitivity when issues are tense or problematic. </li><li>Swiss people are very patriotic. They are also very private. Show your interest in Switzerland and local culture (remember there are German Swiss, Italian and French Swiss!) but do not ask personal questions about age, marital status, religion.</li></ol> </p><p></p>"

      "body": " <p>The Swiss are pragmatic and hard working, and obsessed (it may appear) with efficiency and quality. There is a certain feeling (usually right) that Swiss products are superior to cheaper imitations. This said, the Swiss do not flaunt their wealth. Ostentatious behaviour and lifestyle trappings, bragging about achievements and name-dropping are all considered vulgar <img height=\"167\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Swit.4;0.jpg\" width=\"172\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">and socially unacceptable. </p> <p>The Swiss are very private people, and prefer to keep work and personal life separate. Swiss people don't wear their hearts on their sleeves; the feeling is that if you have a problem, you should try to solve it yourself rather than expecting someone else to take responsibility.</p> <p>While a good business plan and excellent credentials are more important than being able to bond with your Swiss counterparts, the country does have a strong business network and who you know is very important, particularly when it comes to making introductions. But ultimately, you will be judged on your ability to deliver, to meet deadlines, to offer top quality after-sales service and to act in an honest and ethical way.</p>"

      "body": " <p>You will make a good impression in Switzerland by being honest, straightforward, serious about your business and able to back up arguments with facts and logic. Dress smartly and conservatively, with <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Swit.5;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">clean, polished shoes and understated but quality accessories. Always, always turn up on time for meetings and show respect for the rather formal way in which the Swiss address one another (using Mr, Dr etc until invited to use first names).</p> <p>Observe the social norm of not asking too many personal questions. Age, income, family circumstances and so on are taboo subjects. The Swiss keep themselves to themselves and people do not get involved in one another's problems. If you have a problem, you are expected to try to solve it yourself. </p> <p>Privacy is important. The Swiss are not particularly impressed by celebrity or great wealth - they are surrounded by it. Strict laws supporting privacy exist in banking and law, with stiff penalties for anybody who breaks them.</p> <p>Managers should observe the national love of consensus. Everybody must have their say in decision-making, even if the decision is ultimately made by the manager. Instead of trying to force your view on a project, influence it by getting involved and making yourself indispensable. </p>"

      "body": " <p><b>Business cards</b></p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Swit.6;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Business cards are exchanged at all meetings, so bring a good supply. When you arrive for an appointment, hand your card to the receptionist and keep a second one for your contact. It is not necessary to translate your business card unless your job title is especially complicated.</p> <p>More emphasis is placed on hierarchy within the company than on academic achievement, so be sure to show your job title clearly. It is not necessary to list professional qualifications, although it is acceptable to use Dr if you are a PhD.</p> <p>While there is no special card-giving ritual in Switzerland, it is polite to keep somebody's card on the table while you are having a meeting with them.</p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>Body language in Switzerland is not a great giveaway. People tend to be quite formal in meetings. Slouching or putting your feet up would be considered rude or unprofessional. An attentive manner is important. Don't chew gum in meetings, or talk with your hands in your pockets may be perceived as a little too casual for comfort.</p> <p>Effusive gestures are tolerated but not necessarily liked. Backslapping or thumping the table for emphasis may be seen as over-familiar and a loss of personal control. Swiss people will keep their distance physically and emotionally, so do not get too close and make someone uncomfortable. </p> <p><b>Gift-giving</b></p> <p>Switzerland does have a culture of business gift-giving - suitable gifts include glossy books about your own country; quality whisky or cognac; and tasteful items bearing a company logo.</p> <p>Unsuitable items include cheap watches (you may be laughed at privately for presenting these); chocolate that is anything but top quality; roses (a gesture of romantic love) and chrysanthemums (better for funerals).</p> <p>Knives are generally considered to represent the cutting of a bond, although a lot of companies do give miniature Swiss army knives bearing their logo as a gift.</p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>The Swiss are fairly direct and frank communicators after a fashion but do not give away a lot with their body language. Leaning forward means agreement, whereas leaning backward indicates suspicion. Crossing the arms is a sign of shutting out the other party, meaning that the person disagrees or is bored. If a Swiss person is quiet, it could either mean a lack of enthusiasm or that they are listening intently; the Swiss are not given to grand gestures and expressive body language.</p>"

Managers will often make a point of arriving before their staff. So if you want to pin somebody down before they become distracted by their working day, aim for an early start.</p> <p>Prepare an agenda for the meeting and circulate it in advance. It goes without saying that you should turn up on time.</p> <p><b>During the meeting</b></p> <p>In more formal companies, the senior manager will speak first and will lead the discussion. It is rude to address his/her subordinates before speaking to or acknowledging him/her.</p> <p>Business meetings are formal and task-orientated and will follow the agenda. Discussions should be open, with everybody contributing and an aim of arriving at a consensus and leaving the meeting with a clear action plan.</p> <p>The three language groups&nbsp;may all display stereotypical qualities during a meeting (for example, the Italian-speaking Swiss enjoy heated debate, French-speaking Swiss may indulge in rhetorical discussion, German-speaking Swiss may prefer to follow a set of rules) but they will not necessarily behave like Italian, French or German nationals. Do not enter a meeting expecting this or judge the Swiss based on their language group.</p> <p><b>After the meeting</b></p> <p>Be absolutely vigilant about meeting any deadlines that were set during the meeting as your Swiss counterparts will judge you on your ability to deliver. </p> <p>Written communication to follow up a point is better than oral; the Swiss are formal and precise and will put everything in writing themselves.</p>"

Their primary motivations are personal accomplishment and self-determination, along with comfort, security, guarantees, efficiency and order. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Swit.8;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Swiss workers will be motivated by security of employment and by having clear goals towards which to work. People expect to be with a company for a long time and to rise slowly through the ranks. A strong but fair team leader, an accessible but slightly autocratic boss and a structure within which everybody knows their place are all important motivators. Being part of the decision-making process is also important; everybody expects to be allowed to voice an opinion.</p> <p>Money is an important factor to Swiss workers and annual bonuses are a popular form of motivation. Flashy status symbols are less appreciated, like large company cars; many people prefer to use public transport to get to work in any case. Status is not usually demonstrated by having a huge corner office, either; the Swiss consider anything ostentatious to be vulgar.</p>"

They are unlikely to interrupt or to comment on a presentation, but will take notes during it. They will not talk to one another or on their cellphones during a presentation. They will be interested to hear what a speaker has to say, but will not necessarily be swayed by the argument, however impassioned it may be.</p> <p>Time should be left after a presentation for questions and answers, but the reserved Swiss may prefer to pose questions on a one-to-one basis, so make allowances for this, too.</p>"

Employee motivation schemes do exist, but money is a&nbsp;powerful motivator to most Swiss workers.</p> <p>Feedback in the workplace should be given with care, particularly if it's negative. Swiss people like to save 'face' and avoid direct confrontation and aggression. Junior employees may also feel uncomfortable being asked to give feedback on their superiors.</p> <p>Getting feedback from clients is important as the Swiss strive to deliver the highest quality, and great emphasis is placed on customer care and customer loyalty schemes. </p>"
