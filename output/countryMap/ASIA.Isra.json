Israelis live life on the edge, constantly under physical and political attack. They are fatalistic, tough, defiant, and passionate about politics and their culture; this is a country where apathy barely exists.</p> <p>Despite its amazing history, Israel is a relatively new country and everything is still evolving, from the language to the culture and even the cuisine. It's a melting pot in one sense, yet torn apart by racial&nbsp;conflict in another. Everything seems to be a striking contrast, including the Israelis themselves, who are proud of their nickname - sabra - after the fruit of the prickly pear cactus: thorny on the outside, soft on the inside.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Israel is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, with more than 90% of the population living in the northern, less arid part of the country. The population has grown from about 600,000 in 1948 to over 6.2 million, a figure mainly attributed to large-scale immigration from over 100 countries to create a true melting pot.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Isra.1;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">The Hebrew word for immigration (aliyah) means ascent or a spiritual going up. Israel purposefully attracts immigrants with job retraining, housing and tax concessions. A downswing in immigration figures is cause for national concern.</p> <p>In 1950, the Knesset (parliament) passed the Law of Return, by which any Jew could settle in Israel. Two thousand years of wandering were officially over. Since then, Jews have been entitled to simply show up and declare themselves to be Israeli citizens, assuming they posed no imminent danger to public health, state security, or the Jewish people as a whole. Essentially, all Jews everywhere are Israeli citizens by right.</p> <p>In 1955, the law was amended slightly to specify that dangerous criminals could also be denied that right.</p> <p>In 1970, Israel took another historic step by granting automatic citizenship not only to Jews, but also to their non-Jewish children, grandchildren, and spouses, and to the non-Jewish spouses of their children and grandchildren. This addition not only ensured that families would not be broken apart, but also promised a safe haven in Israel for non-Jews subject to persecution because of their Jewish roots.</p> <p>Many Jewish immigrants in the early years of nationhood came from Arab countries and from Europe, following the Holocaust. More recently, Jewish immigration has come from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia. In the decade from 1990 to 2000, over one million immigrants arrived from the former Soviet Union. It is estimated that the joint population of Israel and Palestinian Authority areas will be 12 million by the year 2020.</p> <p>The population, which is mainly middle class, is focused mainly around Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and cities like Haifa on the coast. To the south, the only major population centre is the resort of Eilat on the Red Sea.</p> <p>Israel has some 265 working kibbutzim, voluntary collective, mainly agricultural communities where communal living is practiced and democracy is exercised in its purest form. Although the number of people living on a kibbutz is decreasing, the democratic and consensual values of kibbutz life permeate society still. So does religion, which in Israel, is inextricably bound up with politics. Although only 20% of the Jewish population is observant, many secular Jews still observe the Sabbath and the Jewish holidays and way of life.</p> <p>Israel is a place where old and new literally co-exist, side by side. Although the USA has had a huge influence on society and its habits, there are large pockets of traditional culture in every settlement, from open air markets to the mekolet, or neighbourhood store, a good source of gossip and community spirit.</p>"

Israel has one of the lowest rates of alcoholism in the developed world. </li><li><b>Nightlife</b>: Tel Aviv is one of the world's liveliest cities, with people, including families, walking on the beach in the small hours of the morning, and a vibrant nightlife culture.

But despite the global influences on the country, Israeli culture is strong. Most television viewers, for example, prefer to watch stations which broadcast in Hebrew. Several dozen local movies are produced each year, and local pop groups have excelled in fusing western and eastern rhythms to create uniquely Israeli music. And hamburgers, hot dogs and pizzas are rivalled in popularity by falafel and shawarma - lamb or turkey grilled on a horizontal spit and eaten in pita bread. </li><li><b>Going to the beach</b>: There are fine beaches along the coast, particularly in Tel Aviv, and the Red Sea resort of Eilat is a popular holiday spot, for its tourist infrastructure and fine scuba diving. </li><li><b>Politics</b>: Israelis are highly political. Politics is talked about by everybody, everywhere and opinions run strong.</li></ul> </p><p></p>"

      "body": " <p>Working with the Israelis is highly rewarding once you have cracked their tough exterior, but can be frustrating. The country is steeped in bureaucracy and rules and regulations change constantly as more layers are added. Business contacts are constantly disappearing on military duty in the reserves. The labour unions are powerful and strikes are common. On the plus side, Israelis are fairly informal, with little regard for title.</p> <p>There are only a few hard and fast etiquette rules for working with Israelis, simply because many different cultures exist together. American or European business practice may be the norm in one company, while another may have an Arabic culture. The main thing to remember is that it is important to appear confident, flexible, polite but not obsequious, and to speak directly. A straight answer is appreciated. Israelis also expect everything to be done immediately; patience is not a national virtue.</p> <p>Respect the fact that Israelis expect to have decision-making powers and to use their initiative. It is also important to maintain a good relationship with your Israeli counterpart, as business here is relationship-based. Phone rather than email, and visit rather than appoint a representative.</p>"

A firm handshake, a lively interest in things, a direct gaze - vitality is important here, not deference. At the first meeting, you should be smartly dressed, attentive and exude confidence.</p> <p>Being opinionated is fine, but you should know your topic. Israelis are highly informed and have strong views, many of them shocking to an outsider, about their situation.</p> <p>An ability to get things done quickly makes a good impression as Israelis are impatient and want everything 'yesterday'. But if you are an overseas supplier to Israel, it is very important to stick to the delivery you have promised, or your Israeli counterpart will lose faith.</p>"

      "id": 6,
      "body": " <p><b>Business Cards</b></p> <p>Israelis tend to play down professional titles but business cards are nonetheless important, and should be printed in English. You could however opt for an extra touch which may just impress, by printing the reverse side in Hebrew. It is polite to acknowledge someone's card when they give it to you - to read it and perhaps comment on it.</p> <p><b>Body Language</b></p> <p>While people in Western Europe and North America are mindful of their personal space and the awkwardness caused when people get too close, this is exactly what you must expect in Israel. Here, <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Isra.6;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">conversations are conducted at closer distances, and accompanied by touching. You should not - and this applies particularly to women - misinterpret the intention behind it. Having said that, women should avoid initiating such contact themselves.</p> <p>The Israeli is ready for immediate action. You can witness this by how many Israelis sit - leaning forward with legs spread apart - ready to stand at a moment's notice. He or she may lean back in their chair, place their hands on the back of their head. Do not interrupt this as arrogance. This is informality. Sit the same way (echoing) and watch how your relationship comes together.</p> <p>The Israeli will ask you to wait by placing their hand up, palm towards their body with fingers coming together - and the hand may shake.</p> <p>When you shake someone's hand, lean towards them and repeat their name as they introduce themselves. This is a sign that you are interested in them.</p> <p>Constant gesturing while talking is the norm, but pointing is considered rude. Likewise any gesture involving the thumb, which tends to cause offence throughout the Middle East.</p> <p>When it comes to dealing with Arabs, bear in mind that they consider the left hand to be unclean, with the right hand only used for eating. Showing the bottom of your foot to an Arab is considered gravely offensive, so if sitting on the floor in a group, do so in such a way as to keep your feet pointing away.</p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>Israelis are famous for their bluntness, which many visitors may find unnerving and offensive at first, particularly when asked direct questions like 'How much do you earn?'. This stems from the early pioneer culture, when people had to form strong, familial bonds to build the new land, and had to get things done quickly in hard times. There wasn't time for social niceties and the early Zionists saw themselves as one big family - and you can be direct when talking to family members. Being polite also almost suggests servility, which is something Israelis have never indulged in.</p> <p>Israelis may appear cold and indifferent at first, but the informality of business interactions may also include hugging, intimate conversations, nicknames, back slapping, eating with fingers and other behaviors that could be described as familial. Israelis can be very passionate and expressive. The Israeli can yell and scream at a colleague one moment and a few minutes later be seen hugging the person in question. This venting of frustration seems to have a beneficial effect, as Israelis are not the type of people to bottle things up.</p> <p>Israelis are direct, upfront communicators in business and will not cope with the more subtle styles of Britain and America. Yes means yes, no means no. The American or British concept of saying 'We'll be in touch', which essentially means 'We probably won't' is alien to Israelis.</p> <p><b>Gift-giving</b></p> <p>While Israelis are quite generous when it comes to gift giving, the business community tends to recognise that over-lavish gifts may not be appropriate. So small items such as corporate promotional gifts or books are quite acceptable, the former particularly if you happen to know your host's tastes or interests. If you are invited to your host's home, some flowers would be well received. Note however that if you take some kind of food item, you must be aware of your host's religious outlook. Non-kosher food for an Orthodox Jew, for example, would be a faux-pas best avoided. Pork and shellfish are also best avoided altogether. Israelis are not big drinkers, so flowers or chocolates might go down better than alcohol.</p>"

While it's essential to get to know your counterpart, this must be done in an unpretentious way. Excessive politeness and obsequiousness in Israel are seen as phoney, and this applies to meetings, too. So by all means make conversation, but not in an ingratiating manner. You will find Israelis very opinionated but you are not necessarily expected to agree with them.</p> <p>Israelis are welded to their mobile phones and will think nothing of taking calls during a meeting - or over dinner, or mid-conversation. Meetings may also be interrupted by uninvited guests. Do not take either of these personally This is a very informal society, where Israelis are expected and able to do many tasks at the same time. </p> <p>Do not be put out by the Israeli conversational style during a meeting. This includes constant, mid-sentence interruption, question-poaching, (where, just as you open your mouth, an Israeli third-party answers a question addressed to you,) and asking strangers highly personal questions.</p> <p><b>After a meeting</b></p> <p>If a deal was struck, follow it up in writing. Business may appear to be done on a handshake but a proper contract is important. Involve lawyers after, not during a meeting.</p>"

People have, however, moved on from their historic roots now and many Israelis today are eager to live as individuals, guided by private rather than <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Isra.8;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">public aspirations, so motivational techniques need to offer financial rewards. Israel has a high standard of living but the cost of living is very high and money is a strong motivator.</p> <p>Business in Israel is highly sophisticated, and numerous consultancies exist to advise on motivational techniques. Many companies use team-building events as a natural complement to the army service which gives Israelis such a firm grounding in teamwork, arranging anything from outward bound courses to hosted social events for workers and their families. Many IT companies have big operations in Israel and will run international team-building and motivational events, in which Israeli workers participate. </p> <p>Recognition is a big motivator but money is, too, living in a country with a relatively high cost of living.

You should present your ideas clearly and get straight to the point, using plenty of facts to support your argument. Posturing and putting on a big show will not impress. Use of high-tech equipment is expected; business in Israel is sophisticated, so don't expect to present with a flipchart alone. A PowerPoint presentation is suitable.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Isra.9;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Be prepared for the audience to interrupt and ask questions throughout the presentation. Some of these may seem aggressive, but this is simply the Israeli style. It is rarely meant in a hostile way. Some questions may lead to lively discussion and debate around the table, so it is up to you to control the situation in a subtle way and actually get to the end of the presentation.</p> <p>Do not be surprised or distressed if people take calls on their mobile phones, or send emails with their Blackberries during your presentation. Israelis are multi-taskers.</p> <p><b>Audience expectations</b></p> <p>An Israeli audience expects a decent, fairly slick presentation in English, with good supporting arguments and facts to back it up. They expect to be allowed to interrupt with questions, which you should be prepared for. They also expect detailed handouts afterwards, which can be produced in English, although you should consider Hebrew translation depending on the type of company you are dealing with.</p>"

At the very least, try to learn some of the many Hebrew terms which infiltrate everyday business English.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Isra.10;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Coming to terms with the apparently abrupt manner of Israelis takes time, but you will get used to it - many people end up adopting it themselves after a while when dealing with Israeli contacts! The direct way of communicating is, in any case, a bonus when it comes to things like conflict resolution, as Israelis want quick results to problems and have a proactive approach to problem-solving.</p> <p>One of the biggest challenges of managing relationships is understanding the many cultural influences that make up Israel today. You may be managing teams of naturalised Israelis who are from Russia, the USA, Ethiopia and Eastern Europe, as well as mixed teams with Jews and Israeli Arabs in them. While such a juggling job is ultimately rewarding, it requires huge skill, tact and understanding and strong management skills. Another challenge facing Israeli companies today is dealing with an increasingly global market, and strengthening their sales, marketing, public relations and human resources skills. </p>"
