The country is synonymous with the world ecotourism but not known for its cultural riches. It has no glorious past of ancient and mysterious civilisations and no national psyche shaped by Spanish occupation and a subsequent struggle for independence. It is heavily influenced by North America.</p> <p>Ticos are polite, reserved and less spontaneous than other Latin Americans. There is a strong middle class and a high standard of living. Confrontation is avoided; the country hasn&#039;t even had an army since 1948. People believe in equality and education. Flashy, arrogant behaviour is looked down on. Costa Rica has been called a nation of farmers; despite the sophisticated lifestyle of modern Ticos, many people have a desire for a simple, rural life, with traditional values.</p> "

      "body": "<p>Costa Rica (meaning \"rich coast\") has a population of 4.2 million in which 95 percent is of European or mestizo (mixed) descent, 3 percent black or mulatto, 1 percent East Asian (primarily Chinese), and 1 percent Amerindian. About 51 percent of Costa Ricans live in urban centres (one million in San Jose), although even these people adhere to their rural roots and traditional values <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$NoAm.Cost.1;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">- it&#039;s not uncommon, for example, for city dwellers to grow their own vegetables and in all the country&#039;s cities, the centres are almost entirely commercial, with residential areas around the outside.</p> <p>Immigration has become a serious issue and today, some 20% of the population is refugees from struggling Nicaragua, who compete with Costa Ricans for jobs and access to the overburdened health and welfare systems. As the economy changes from that of a banana and coffee growing base to high-tech industries and tourism, society changes with it, with increasing influence from North America on everything from food to entertainment.</p>"

      "body": "<p>Ticos work to live rather than live to work and free time is both appreciated and used to the full. Most activities take place in large groups of family and friends; families are extended and close-knit and weekends are often taken up with extended lunches, or picnics in the park or on the beach. In the rainy season, there&#039;s a thriving coffee shop culture. There&#039;s a lively calendar of fiestas - each town has at least one a year - and during these, parades, dancing, eating, drinking and bullfights (the bull isn&#039;t killed) take place.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$NoAm.Cost.2;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">North American food, television and culture has a strong influence in Costa Rica, particularly when it comes to cinema and soap operas. San Jose has American-style shopping malls, although many people shop in the more colourful local markets, too.</p> <p>Costa Ricans are obsessed with football and every community has a football pitch. Life stops for big matches and the 1990 achievement in the World Cup of reaching the quarter finals led to the President declaring a national holiday. Surfing is also hugely popular, as are cycling and jogging. Most people can&#039;t afford to join an gym and in any case, prefer to exercise outdoors.</p> <p>European influences led to a great number of museums, galleries and theatres in San Jose, although life in rural areas is a lot simpler. There is a thriving artistic community, attracted by the country&#039;s beauty, light and easygoing lifestyle. Although Costa Rica didn&#039;t generate any towering literary figures in history, there are many successful authors here today.</p> <p>Music plays a big part in Tico life, from European and American imports to traditional African styles to calypso (on the Caribbean coast).</p> <p>Costa Rica has a high rate of alcoholism, estimated as much as 20%, more than any other central American country. </p>"

These ties carry into the workplace.</li> <li>Most Ticos are mestizo - a mixture of Indian, Spanish and sometimes black ancestors - but they consider themselves white.</li> <li>Ticos are inherently conservative and resistant to change. They are not risk-takers.</li> <li>Some 50,000 North American expatriates live in Costa Rica and influence cultural and market forces.</li> <li>While 75% of Ticos claim to be Roman Catholics, there is still a flourishing trade in superstition and witchcraft and pagan rituals and beliefs often manifest themselves in everyday life.</li> <li>Learn to ask questions that will require a specific answer. Anything with a &#039;yes&#039; or &#039;no&#039; answer may not generate results, as Ticos usually say yes.</li> <li>Network enthusiastically in business. The business community is small and Ticos are great gossips, so your reputation is likely to precede you.</li> <li>Do careful market research. Costa Rica is a tempting but changeable market.</li> <li>Never shout at people, especially in public. Ticos respect calm control in others.</li></ol> </p>"

      "body": "<p>Foreign investors are attracted to Costa Rica for the stable economy, the cheap, educated and mainly bilingual workforce, the strong infrastructure and the good record of labour relations.

A large percentage of the workforce is also employed in tourism, mainly eco-tourism projects around the national parks and along the two coasts.</p> <p>Business etiquette is not dissimilar to that of Northern Europe and North America, thanks to the strong American influence here, although Latin culture and the Catholic faith mean there are some clear differences, particularly when it comes to attitudes to time, work-life balance and even superstition. Personal relationships are very important and business entertaining plays a big part in getting to know someone. Ticos like an easy, non-confrontational life at home and in the workplace and are known for their formal politeness and their willingness to avoid conflict at any cost. This can lead to problems, as it is difficult to get a straight answer out of anybody who fears they may offend you or lose &#039;face&#039;.</p>"

Adjust your expectations to &#039;Tico time&#039;. Make an effort to learn Spanish, especially &#039;Tiquismos&#039; (local slang) so you can fit in with your colleagues and understand their humour. </p> <p>Always accept hospitality and be sure to return it.

      "body": "<p><strong><img style=\"margin-left: 10px\" alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$NoAm.Cost.6;0.jpg\" align=\"right\" border=\"1\">Business cards</strong></p> <p>Business cards (tarjeta de negocio) are important and everybody has one. It&#039;s not essential to list academic qualifications; only Ph.Ds tend to do this. Accept a card politely and examine it before putting it away.</p> <p><strong>Body language</strong></p> <p>Ticos are demonstrative and will gesticulate more than North Americans and Northern Europeans, and certainly a lot more than Asians. They stand close together, so it is important not to shrink away if somebody talks to you at close distance or touches your arm to make a point.</p> <p><strong>Communication style</strong></p> <p>Communication style is very formal and polite. Greetings are exchanged everywhere - in shops and restaurants, with lengthy goodbyes on the telephone and constant affirmations of affection for one&#039;s family. Communication is, however, often indirect. The most important thing for Ticos is to quedar bien, a mixture between saving face and avoiding conflict. Non-committal answers to questions are commonplace.</p> <p><strong>Gift giving</strong></p> <p>A token gift from your own country is appreciated but not expected. If you are invited to somebody&#039;s home, which is extremely unlikely, take a good bottle of wine or spirits, or flowers that are not lilies (which are for funerals). Do not confuse a gift with a bribe. Mordidas are small payments to speed up a process, and chorizos (actually a kind of sausage) are a form of illegally supplementing one&#039;s income with bribes. Bribery is illegal and can result in deportation. Always observe your corporate culture, the laws of your country and the laws of Costa Rica.</p>"

Meetings are for examining a situation and covering the facts, not always with a view to making a decision. In fact, a decision is extremely unlikely to be made at a meeting. People may come and go during the meeting and it is also socially acceptable to answer one&#039;s mobile phone if it rings (although you, as a guest, should not do this),</p> <p><strong>Following a meeting</strong></p> <p>Expect to have several meetings before getting a result. Decision-making is slow and even if a Tico says &#039;yes&#039; to something, they don&#039;t necessarily mean it. To this end, get agreements in writing and include as much detail as you feel you can without appearing untrusting. Yes could mean no, or maybe, so it is important to be clear.</p> <p>Business entertaining is an important part of getting to know Costa Ricans, so a good meeting should be celebrated with dinner. Business lunches tend to be short and less relaxed, as most people do not take a long lunch break.</p>"

A work culture which involves many late nights and weekends is unacceptable to them.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$NoAm.Cost.8;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">People are motivated by a fairly nurturing, comfortable environment, in which they can preserve their sense of dignity and equality. They don&#039;t like risk or confrontation and do not respond well to aggression, tight deadlines or a focus that is exclusively on the bottom line. Relationships are important and are for the long term.</p> <p>Ticos are also motivated by money and benefits. Although local salaries are low, workers are guaranteed certain benefits like a Christmas bonus, but will be inspired by further bonuses. The middle class is becoming increasingly materialistic and is getting further into debt to fund expensive clothing habits. </p> <p>Corporate events and incentive travel are not generally used as motivators; for most people, a social life revolves around family and friends outside the office and Ticos have no special desire to extend their social circles into the workplace. Some companies do, however, lay on family events as a reward or a thank you.</p>"

      "body": "<p>Many Ticos have studied English and although it is acceptable to make a presentation in English if your local contact advises you to, it is polite to learn enough Spanish to greet people. This is a good way of getting off on the right foot, as Ticos are used to dealing with tourists or ex-pats who make no effort whatsoever to learn Spanish. If the audience is not <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$NoAm.Cost.9;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">known to be bilingual, there is a good chance most people will only have rudimentary English and the presentation should be made in Spanish or through an interpreter. Either way, supporting materials should be in Spanish, as should your promotional literature. Be sure to have translation done by a local so you can make correct use of Costa Rican idiom and business terms. Remember that Costa Ricans address one another using the formal &#039;Usted&#039;, even sometimes among friends.</p> <p>Presentations should emphasise the personal, the long term relationship and the service you are planning to provide to Costa Rica. An audience expects a chance to ask questions, so build in Q&amp;A time at the end. Don&#039;t be surprised if the presentation is interrupted, or if people take calls on their mobile phones while you are talking.</p>"
