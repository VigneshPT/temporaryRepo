They are risk-orientated and very creative. Great importance is placed on family and social life and many families are very large. Brazilians are also governed by a class system. Money, family and education talk here.</p> <p>Nothing annoys Brazilians more than to be considered Spanish or Latin American like their neighbours; indeed, the Portuguese had a completely different colonial experience from the Spanish in colonial times, intermarrying with the natives rather than killing them, resulting in a mixed-race population. Four million African slaves were transported to Brazil, seven times the number transported to the US. The majority of the population is black, or partly so. Only Nigeria has a larger black population.</p> <p>Many of the stereotypes about Brazil are actually true; the obsession with soccer, the rich scenery, the glamorous beach life and on the negative side, the social inequality, poverty and crime level.</p>"

Over 90 percent of the people live on 10 percent of the land, and over 20 million live in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p>Brazil's ethnic composition is 55 percent European descent (primarily Portuguese), 38 percent a mixture of cultures (African, German, Japanese, Amerindian, and so forth), 6 <img height=\"200\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$SoAm.Braz.1;0.jpg\" width=\"152\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">percent African, and only 1 percent Amerindian. Nearly 50 percent of the population is under twenty years of age.</p> <p>People live mainly along the coastal areas of the south and north-eastern states. Industrial activity is concentrated in the southeast, with 50% of the industrial production located in S&atilde;o Paulo.</p> <p>Migration from the northeast to the southeast and urbanisation have been heavy since 1970. More recently, the population flow has turned towards the less inhabited central-western and northern regions. The fertility rate fell from 6.3 children per woman in the early 1960s to 4.4 in the 1980s. This led to a decrease of the annual rate of population growth from 2.9% in the 1960s, to less than 1.9% in the 1990s.</p> <p>Portuguese is the official language, although some of the population speak Spanish, Italian, or various Amerindian languages. There is no official religion, although the predominant religion is Roman Catholic (about 90 percent of the population). Some 16 percent practice Afro-Brazilian religions that combine tribal and Catholic beliefs (Spiritual Catholics) and Evangelical Catholics make up 9 percent. Protestants, Judaism, Buddhism, and other religions account for less than 9 percent.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Be prepared to commit long-term resources (both in time and money) toward establishing strong relationships in Brazil. This is the key to business success and applies within the workplace as well as with customers and suppliers.</p> <p>It may come as a surprise to learn that Brazilians are very much governed by the concept of 'face', like Asian countries. Social interaction should be geared towards not causing someone to lose face, and not losing face yourself. Remaining calm and rational during business transactions is important. Brazilians are inherently polite and rather formal; do not assume that just because you are in South America, people are all hot-headed Latins.</p> <p>Brazilians can also be quite snobbish and status-conscious, although they will only be able to judge a foreigner on their appearance and demeanour. Education, family background and money are considered very important here, so it is important to act with dignity and good manners at all times, and to dress well.</p> <p>Although Brazil is by no means a sleepy backwater, business does move at a slower pace. Negotiations and decisions take longer than they do in the USA and northern Europe, and meetings may run overtime. Social events almost always run late into the night.</p>"

      "body": " <p>First impressions are very important in Brazilian culture. Despite the size of the population, the business community is relatively small and the sociable nature of commerce means that word can get around very quickly. This can be either a disadvantage or an advantage depending on the success of initial meetings.</p> <p><img height=\"133\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$SoAm.Braz.5;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Personal relationship building is the key to successful business. Respect for your associates is critical and having contacts who are well connected can make business dealings much easier. Brazilians are very astute people. In a society accustomed to people with ulterior motives, they do not suffer foolish foreigners gladly. Empathy will take you far, and a mere modicum of interest in the people will win you loyalty and kindness.</p> <p>You will make a good impression if you speak some Portuguese, and a very bad one if you start speaking Spanish, which is an insult to Brazilians. At the beginning of and throughout the conversation it is important to appear self-assured. During conversation it is important to keep a soft-spoken manner. </p> <p>Soccer (football), family, Brazil's beautiful beaches and the country's rapid growth are all appropriate conversation topics. Politics, poverty, religion, Argentina (considered a rival) and the deforestation of Brazil are not. Personal topics such as age, salary and marital or job status are also unacceptable. </p>"

      "title": "Business Etiquette",
      "body": " <p>In Brazil, business people tend to be fairly laid-back. It nevertheless makes good sense to arrive at a business meeting wearing a suit and tie, although sometimes even investment bankers wear \"smart casual\" to the office. Brazilians tend to work late, especially at senior level, so you should not be surprised if a meeting is scheduled for after 6pm. Try not to be late - \"pontualidade brit&acirc;nica\" (British punctuality) is all about being there right on time. Having said that, strict punctuality may be found to apply rather more when the meeting involves lunch or dinner - at other times you can expect Brazilians to be more lax. In the big cities, traffic problems will often be the real reason for someone arriving late.</p> <p><b>Communication</b></p> <p>Brazilians are generally very social and place emphasis on relationships. This attitude extends to business dealings and should be considered when communicating with Brazilian associates. The communication style, however, can be indirect and circular. Saving 'face' is as important to a Brazilian as it is to a Chinese or Japanese person and your counterpart will talk carefully to <img height=\"138\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$SoAm.Braz.6;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">avoid offending you and causing you to lose face. It is important to adopt this style; it's better to apologise for something you may have done, for example, to save the other person's face, rather than trying to prove a point.</p> <p>It is generally considered impolite to get down to business straight away. Also, while it is not advisable to ask personal questions, be prepared to answer them. Brazilians are generally quite animated in their communication. They often stand close together and make physical contact during conversations. Maintaining eye contact is also a very powerful tool when communicating. It is considered impolite not to maintain steady eye contact during a conversation. </p> <p>Brazilians tend to speak quickly and conversations are very lively. Be prepared for lots of interjections and debate - this shows that people are interested in the conversation. </p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>Brazilians are very expressive and tend to use body language and gestures frequently. Physical contact is common and visitors may find that they stand quite close to each other. It is important not to back away, as closeness is a sign that the other person is interested in the conversation and you. Some actions and gestures may be recognisable but have a completely different meaning. For example, the 'okay' sign of the thumb and forefinger making a circle is vulgar and insulting in Brazil. Touching arms and elbows and backs is very common.</p> <p>To express appreciation, a Brazilian may appear to pinch his earlobe between thumb and forefinger. To invoke good luck, place your thumb between your index an middle finders while making a fist. This is also known as the \"fig\". Flicking the fingertips underneath the chin indicates that you do not know the answer to a question.</p> <p><b>Gift giving</b></p> <p>Giving a gift is not required at a first business meeting; instead offer to buy lunch or dinner. In general, gifts are given when some form of relationship has been established as a symbol of the strengthening of the relationship. Present a gift in a relaxed, social atmosphere rather than during a serious business liaison. </p> <p>A general rule for those who are giving gifts is to opt for something that is practical, such as electronic gifts or tasteful accessories and stationery for the office. Alternatively a tasteful souvenir from your home country is acceptable. Do not give anything too expensive, which may be construed as an offer of a bribe.</p> <p>Gifts to avoid giving in Brazil are anything black or purple in colour because those are colours of mourning. Also, do not give anything sharp such as scissors, knives, or letter openers because they are interpreted as a severing of a relationship. </p> <p><b>Business cards</b></p> <p>Exchanging business cards is very common in Brazil, so it is best to have plenty to give out. When a Brazilian is exchanging business cards, it is common for them to underline part of their name indicating how they would like to be addressed, whether it be by their Christian name; their title followed by their Christian name; or their title and surname. Have your business cards translated into Portuguese. There are various establishments in the cities that can do this within a 24-hour period. </p>"

      "body": " <p><b>Planning a Meeting</b></p> <p>When scheduling meetings with Brazilians, it is best to expect a degree of tardiness. A meeting will run <img height=\"133\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$SoAm.Braz.7;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">on until the business is done. Senior executives tend to be more accessible in Brazil than in other countries, so choose somebody of similar rank in your company to meet them. Do not appear impatient if you are kept waiting. Brazilians see time as something outside their control and the demands of relationships takes precedence over adhering to a strict schedule.</p> <p>Having a Brazilian contact with a good pool of contacts means instant credibility for you and your company, as does a basic command of Portuguese.</p> <p>Have all of your materials translated into Portuguese, including letterheads and business cards where possible.</p> <p><b>During a Meeting</b></p> <p>Never start into business discussions before your host does. Business meetings normally begin with casual 'chatting' first Initial meetings may be quite formal, although the atmosphere will become more relaxed as the two sides get to know one another better.</p> <p>Brazilians place an emphasis on financial proficiency, so be prepared with facts and figures.</p> <p>Although meetings can be quite long in Brazil, it is still important to make a concise and well prepared pitch at the first meeting, because there may not be a second chance.</p> <p>It is not uncommon for meetings to be interrupted. This is not considered rude, although you should avoid interrupting the meeting yourself, for example, by receiving and making calls on your cellphone.</p> <p><b>Following a Meeting</b></p> <p>Don¹t rush off at the end of the meeting. Be prepared to stay behind, as this will demonstrate how important the business is to you. If it is imperative to leave quickly, let your associates know your schedule at the beginning of the meeting.</p> <p>If you follow up by email, recognise that the use of jargon or colloquialisms could cause confusion and your tone may be misinterpreted. Business correspondence is more formal in Latin America, where the use of elegant language denotes good manners. It is wise to get everything in writing. Ensure you are meeting with the decision-makers, otherwise your contract or bid approval may take much longer than anticipated as it will have to make its way up the corporate hierarchy.</p>"

Employees want to feel that somebody cares about their career path, and will offer them support along the way. Work-life balance is also very important; Brazilians are not likely to push themselves extra hard without good reason (although senior executives do work long hours). Having a social life outside the office is critical.</p> <p>Brazilians are, of course, motivated by money, just like any culture, more so in the south where people tend to be more businesslike and influenced by American corporate culture. Equality is important here. If a team is set a target and makes it, it's common to give everybody a bonus as a proportion of their salary. Giving one person more than the others, or promoting them above the others will disrupt the balance of the team and cause the rest of the team to lose face. If an extra bonus is to be awarded (which it often is), it must be done privately and not discussed with the rest of the team.</p>"

      "title": "Effective Presentations",
      "body": " <p>Brazilians do not appreciate realms of written information. If you are using slides, use them for headings only and then elaborate on each one verbally. Brazilians like a good storyteller and plenty of examples, so bring these into a presentation. They also see themselves as objective decision-makers, so a presentation should include all the facts and a strong argument, supported by financial information.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$SoAm.Braz.9;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Do not jump straight into the body of the presentation. As in a business meeting, you need to take a little time to introduce yourself and built a relationship with the audience. Humour is acceptable if it's culturally applicable. Don't use humour just for the sake of it. Breaking the ice is more important than telling jokes. A hard sell is not appreciated; putting an audience on the spot may cause them to lose face, which is not conducive to doing business.</p> <p>How the presentation is delivered should be tailored to the type of companies involved and their location within Brazil. The north has a slower, more laid-back pace of life, while the south, from Sao Paolo downwards, is more businesslike and more American in influence. Executives from large companies tend to be more time-conscious; those from smaller, family-run businesses or government departments have a more relaxed attitude to time.</p> <p><b>Audience expectations</b></p> <p>Audiences expect a chance to ask questions after a presentation (and may well ask some during its course as well). But what is most likely is that the presenter will be approached privately by an individual with a question. Brazilians are incredibly protective of information and may not want the rest of the audience to share the answer to a particularly burning question. This question may be slipped into the conversation in the midst of apparent small talk, so presenters should be ready with an answer.</p>"

If you <img height=\"133\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$SoAm.Braz.10;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">are managing a Brazilian team, it is important to work on your relationship with every team member, and to give each of them regular opportunities to raise any concerns in private. </p> <p>The same applies to suppliers and customers; frequent visits are important. Do not try to do business or finalise deals by email or fax. Show your commitment by entertaining customers and suppliers and getting to know them better.</p> <p>When dealing with conflict, be careful to handle the situation appropriately. Do not cause a Brazilian to lose face and if you are criticising something, emphasise the positive first and then offer your criticism constructively. Listen carefully to what people are saying; Brazilians often communicated in a vague, circular way and you may miss an important point if you are not paying attention. Remember that Brazilians are highly motivated by good relationships in the workplace. Feeling comfortable at work and with one's colleagues is as important as receiving an annual bonus.</p>"
