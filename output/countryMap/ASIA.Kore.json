In Confucian tradition, the father is the head of the family and it is his responsibility to provide food, clothing and shelter, and to approve the marriages of family members. The eldest son has special duties: first to his parents, then to his brothers from older to younger, then to his sons, then to his wife, and lastly to his daughters. Family welfare is considered much more important than the needs of the individual.</p> <p>Members of the family are tied to each other because the actions of one family member reflect on the rest of the family; in many cases the family register can trace a family's history, through male ancestors, for over 500 years.</p> <p>Children are raised to believe they can never repay their debt to their parents, hence the popularity of ancestor worship.</p>"

The population is almost exclusively South Korean, with very little immigration apart from a very small Chinese minority. Some 74% of the population is located in the urban areas and 45% of the population live in apartment blocks.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Kore.1;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">South Korea has a very complex history and over the centuries the people have suffered greatly. As such, they have become stoic in their attitudes and have pride in their toughness and ability to survive the hard times. They are very proud of their country's achievements.</p> <p>The culture follows Confucian teaching and there is strong pressure within the society for conformity to the group. The welfare of the group takes precedence over the individual. This is shown in the employee obedience and loyalty to his or her employer. Nevertheless, Koreans believe very much in democratic and pluralist government where people have freedom of choice and the ability to speak their opinion freely.</p> <p>Social interaction within society is dictated and regulated by rituals and formalities encompassing courtesy and behaviour towards others.</p> <p>South Korea has developed significantly in the last 20 years, opening up its doors to such highly publicised events such as the Seoul Olympic Games and the Soccer World Cup Finals. These two events alone have raised general awareness of other cultures and values.</p>"

It is based on keeping the body and mind in harmony. It is essential to avoid hurting someone's kibun - a victory secured at someone else's expense is no victory. </li><li>The kibun is fragile and can be easily damaged. The sensitivity required to avoid this is known as nunchi. It involves everything from practicalities such as using both hands to hand something to someone to the emotional antenna required to read another's well-masked emotion. </li><li>The Koreans are patient, industrious and traditional. </li><li>Even those who are not religious are imbued with the Confucian principles of filial piety, loyalty to ruler and spouse, respect of the aged and trust amongst friends. Society is hierarchical - you need to respect local attitudes to age and status. </li><li>Formality is expected and respected. In initial meetings, make sure you are comfortable with the local 'ritual' of business card exchanges. </li><li>Business relationships are at least as important as the deal itself. Third party introductions and referrals can be very helpful in setting a trusting climate. </li><li>Many Korean businessmen have studied in the west, so are well versed in western ways, although in a negotiating situation, they will revert to traditional Korean tactics. </li><li>In order to achieve a clear understanding of issues, Koreans can sometimes ask questions in a very direct manner. These are usually for addtional clarification and are not intended as a 'tactic' to unsettle you. </li><li>Koreans have a sense of humour closer to that of Westerners than, say, Japanese or Chinese. Humour is important in bonding, although it is best left until solid relationships have been established. </li><li>Like many other Asian nationalities, Koreans believe that contracts are a starting point rather than the final stage.</li></ol> </p><p></p>"

      "body": " <p>The Koreans are often known as the Irish of the East because of their sense of humour and enjoyment of drinking. But they are also governed by Confucian principles, based on the unequal relationship in a family between the father, the mother and the children. This also applies to the workplace, which has a strictly delineated hierarchy and a strongly paternalistic leader.</p> <p>Koreans are also similar to the Japanese and Chinese in that they have a strong sense of 'face', known as kibun. This must be maintained at all times as to hurt somebody's kibun is to hurt their dignity, and affects practically every business transaction. Despite the rowdy after-work drinking scene, Koreans are polite and formal in everyday business and there are many rituals governing the etiquette.</p> <p>Working with the Koreans is very much about personal relationships. The whole structure of business is governed by who knows whom and how influential they are. Ties in this close network go right back to people from the same village, or region, or school, or people who knew each other in their first job. Among Koreans, these binding ties are personal, as opposed to the kind of bond a Japanese person might have to their company.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Every year Korea becomes more and more modern, but it is important to recognise that modern does not equal Western. Koreans will not expect you to be an expert on the nuances of their culture, but <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Kore.5;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">they will appreciate a show of interest in matters that are important to them. Koreans generally appreciate a foreigner's effort in expressing a thank you (gam-sa-ham-ni-da) or a hello (an-yang-ha-say-yo) in the Korean language.</p> <p>There are several dos and don'ts in dealing with Koreans. Do emphasise the value of relationships and talk about mutual cooperation. Listen to what the Koreans are saying. Establish common ground and talk about mutual cooperation. Provide the 'big picture' and if you are planning to make changes, keep them small and manageable at first. Use your personal connections and let others see that you are well-connected.</p> <p>Do not show impatience, or too much emotion, or raise your voice. Also, do not only try to ingratiate yourself with the president of a company, as middle managers often have quite a lot of power, particularly in the larger companies, and will be resentful if they are bypassed by an outsider. It is important to treat everybody with the same degree of respect.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Although the Koreans appear friendly, relaxed and almost jolly, there is still a strict protocol to be <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Kore.6;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">followed; manners and tradition are very important in this society. Certain rules govern the presentation of business cards, for example, and the giving of gifts, while meals and even drinking also have a strict procedure. The hierarchy must always be observed and suitable deference shown to the most senior people in any group.</p> <p>In communication, the overriding concern in Korea is kibun, or face, which must be maintained at all time, very similar to the etiquette of Japan and China. This consideration must apply to all business dealings, meetings, everyday conversation in the workplace and social interaction. Strangely, Koreans are surprisingly direct communicators and may ask probing questions about your family and background, but this is to enable them to place you in context rather than as a result of prying.</p> <p>Punctuality is expected, both in business and for social events. If you are kept waiting for a few minutes it will be because of your counterpart's tight schedule. Accept it graciously. Business entertaining in the evening, involving dinner, heavy drinking sessions and even singing, are commonplace. Breakfast meetings are rare.</p>"

      "body": " <p><b>Planning a meeting</b></p> <p>You will need to set up an appointment in advance. Try and arrange appointments between 10 and 12 in the morning or 2 and 3 in the afternoon. Business dinners are common, but breakfast meetings are rare. If in doubt, use a suitable Korean intermediary to set up the introduction. Do not use a lawyer, as this denotes a lack of trust.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Kore.7;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">You will be expected to be punctual, but as many South Korean&nbsp;executives have hectic schedules, you should understand if they are a few minutes late.</p> <p>Do your homework about your counterparts and their status. You need to know where they are in the hierarchy. They need to know the same about you, so it is important to tell them who will be attending the meeting and what their rank is so that they don't lose face. If you have a woman as part of your negotiating team, warn the Koreans ahead of time. All Korean men have higher status than women.</p> <p>Formality is expected and respected, from the sobriety of your suit to the rituals of greeting and the honouring of status.</p> <p>Send your proposals over ahead of the meeting so your counterpart can preview them and prepare their response.</p> <p><b>During the meeting</b></p> <p>Enter the meeting room in order of importance, with the most senior first. The Koreans will also be lined up to greet you according to rank, again, starting with the most senior person. If you aren't sure how to seat Korean guests or where to sit yourself, ask your Korean counterparts.</p> <p>Koreans will want to become acquainted with you before proceeding with business, so be accommodating about seemingly personal questions. In some cases, you may even need to be prepared for several bouts of drinking before you get down to business. Questions of a personal nature may be asked, particularly concerning age, marital status, education, etc. These questions are not thought to be impolite, but rather to help the Koreans to recognise the appropriate social level and speech forms (degree of formality) that they should use when speaking. Since a consensus is important, there will usually be rather lengthy discussions before decisions are made. As a result, business negotiations will usually take much longer when compared to Western business cultures, so patience will be necessary.</p> <p>Generally business is conducted between people of similar rank, although detailed work may be delegated to more junior people. If you are set up for an initial meeting with someone of inferior status to your own, you are not being taken seriously.</p> <p>Always take an interpreter to deal. Even if you speak clearly and simply, your counterpart's spoken English may not be as good as it appears and your Korean will almost certainly not be at a level to cope with the subtleties of the language.</p> <p>Punctuality is appreciated and business meetings should start and finish on time.</p> <p><b>Following a meeting</b></p> <p>In general, Koreans prefer to reach an agreement in principle during negotiations, leaving the details to be sorted out later by juniors.</p> <p>Traditionally, to the Koreans, a contract is a guideline for doing business, not a binding, legally enforceable document. They view contracts as loosely structured consensus statements that broadly define agreement and leave room for flexibility and adjustment as needed. This is changing as people have more contact with the west, but you may still encounter problems with smaller companies. Never sign a contract or write a person's name in red ink as this denotes death.</p> <p>Deals are almost always concluded in person, rather than over the phone or by letter, but you will need to get written confirmation.</p> <p>Once you enter into a major business relationship with a company, you are expected to show them loyalty and run secondary negotiations and deals through them, or you will be considered insincere.</p>"

The <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Kore.8;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">best methods for motivating staff, therefore, involve showing yourself as a wise and caring boss, capable of socialising (drinking and singing) after hours as well as demonstrating professional expertise and competence in the work place. Being involved with the personal as well as business aspect of your subordinates is expected.</p> <p>Union power is strong within Korean business culture, which has a history of caring for employees in ways that go well beyond the expectations of Western business culture. Korean companies often provide housing and accommodation for all family members who in turn are expected to show fierce loyalty to the company. Koreans are, however, also motivated by money and will often do things like choose to forgo holiday entitlement in favour of a cash bonus.</p> <p>Traditionally, employees have gained promotion in their companies based on length of service, which again has its roots with Confucian thinking. Seniority has been the driving force behind the country over the last 40 years. Trade unions are now campaigning for more equitable promotion based on individual abilities, and women are fighting for equality in the workplace. This, when it happens, will be a very strong motivator indeed.</p>"

      "body": " <p>When making a presentation, remember the need for modesty. Do not give a grandiose speech about your personal achievements, or those of your company. Do not talk about profit before emphasising the human aspect of an idea. If you are proposing change of any kind to Koreans, make sure you are completely au fait with the current situation, as they may resist change and will almost certainly be thrown off guard (and therefore lose face) by surprises.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$ASIA.Kore.9;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Most presentations to Koreans will require the services of an interpreter, so allow double the time you normally would. Be very clear in your delivery, using simple language and occasional repetition for emphasis.</p> <p>Break your presentation into small chunks with regular stops for cigarette breaks and question and answer sessions. Use good visual aids, be aware that triangular shapes may be perceived negatively by some members of your audience. Talk directly to the chief negotiator at times, even if he doesn't speak English.</p> <p><b>Audience expectations</b></p> <p>A Korean audience expects an accurate, factual presentation stating the facts, not embellishing them. Breaks must be allowed for smoking and the Koreans may wish to ask questions during the presentation rather than waiting till afterwards. Nobody should lose face as a result of the presentation; it should not contain surprises, sweeping statements or direct criticisms.</p>"

Good people will certainly be drawn to companies with values like this for employment. Having said this, the Korean loyalty often lies with the boss, rather than the company (unlike in Japan) and it is not uncommon for somebody to shadow their boss throughout his or her career.</p> <p>Koreans like to work in a harmonious environment where kibun can be preserved and nurtured. In managing relationships successfully, it is important to understand the nuances of kibun and to spot when it is likely to be damaged, while preserving your own kibun at the same time.</p> <p>Bonds within teams are very strong in Korea and this is fostered by Korean managers, who will put special effort into preserving the harmony within the team. Nobody can get too far ahead of their team mates and nobody will be allowed to lag behind. This means that the strong people on any team carry the weak ones, rather than have the weaker ones naturally weeded out and the strong ones groomed for better things, which is what would happen in the West.</p>"
