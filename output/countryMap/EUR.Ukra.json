While Ukrainians are noted for their stoicism, the long and peaceful demonstrations staged to oppose corruption and to secure fair, democratic elections displayed resilience and well-ordered persistence. The events of 1991, too, showed that when prompted into action, Ukrainians can be determined. </p> <p>Over their long and troubled history, Ukrainians have learnt to be survivors. Through centuries of repression, and certainly in the case of Stalinist rule, the most brutal of treatment, they cherished the notion of their independence and kept their national aspirations alive. The proud history of the Cossacks probably helped and the Ukrainians' strong religious convictions fortified them as well. </p> <p>Ukranians have a strong sense of kinship and family and are generous to visitors. Their new national identity in a post-Soviet world is still taking shape and their tenacity and patience are still needed as poverty remains a problem for many. </p>"

      "body": " <p>While Ukrainians have achieved their much yearned-for independence, life has not been easy since the new nation state came into being in 1991. The population has fallen from 52 million in 1993 to an estimated 47,710,816 today due to the numbers who have emigrated in search of a better life (the Diaspora), many to the United States and Canada. The birth rate has dropped and life expectancy has declined. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Ukra.1;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Life remains a struggle for many in Ukraine with average wages being very low and where an estimated one in three people live below the poverty line. Many people have several jobs and people group together to help each other. Those in professional jobs in large cities - especially Kyiv - are better off. As in Russia, some individuals have become immensely rich, very quickly.</p> <p>The majority of the population lives in the west around the Carpathian mountains, and in the built-up east, while the south and the centre are less populated. Around 15% of the population live in big cities like Kyiv, Lviv, Odesa, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsky. </p> <p>Religion still remains very important to many Ukrainians. There are now three strands of the Orthodox church, with around 10 million followers. The Catholic church however, also has a large following with many of its adherents in the west of the country near Catholic Poland. Religion also has its political implications. One arm of the Orthodox church pays its allegiance to Russia while the Catholic church encourages greater ties with the West. </p> <p>Aside from religion, sport is a popular pastime. Soccer especially is a leading sport and ice hockey has a big following. </p> <p>Regional tensions between the east and west of the country were highlighted in the political events of 2004 when elections were discredited and had to be held again, resulting in the election of Viktor Yushchenko, who nearly died after allegedly being poisoned by his rivals. Russian influences are dominant in the east and south while Ukrainian is more prevalent in the west. Tatars have congregated in the south, in Crimea. </p> <p>Corruption is still said to be a problem in the country and was certainly highlighted in the 2004 elections. The sex trafficking of Ukrainian women has become a serious issue in recent years. </p> <p>Despite all the difficulties, many Ukrainians remain optimistic and have been encouraged by the way in which they have overcome political obstacles and by the drive for economic prosperity. Visitors however, may notice some differences between the older and younger generations. Those who are under 40 will be much more attuned to Western style attitudes and practices. </p>"

They value kindness and hospitality, have great respect for elders and are fond of children who are made very welcome in places like restaurants. As great survivors, Ukrainians also value humour. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Ukra.2;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Ordinary, middle-class Ukrainians still struggle at times to make ends meet. Many, however, learn to make do, have more than one job and, and outside cities, grow their own food. Religion is a pivotal part of life for many but so is sport and football is the leading spectator sport. Folk dance, folk music, classical music and rock are all popular. The film industry is being revived in the last 15 years and Ukrainian art is also enjoying a revival. Ukraine has also produced much-respected writers like Taras Shevchenko. Ukrainians are creative and are especially adroit at weaving, woodcarving and ceramics. </p> <p>Ukrainians are great lovers of nature although environmental protection has still really to be developed in the country. There is also a great fondness food and drink, particularly vodka. Dining out is still a treat for many Ukranians. </p> <p>Many young Ukrainians now especially aspire to getting a good education and a good job. While the country has experienced a great drain of talent in recent years with people leaving in search of a better life elsewhere, there are also signs that this may not continue. Also, some of those who have left are returning to their homeland and are especially in demand after having good experience elsewhere. </p>"

They will tend to look at all aspects of an issue including the disadvantages. </li><li>Recognise that while efforts are being made to eliminate corruption, such practices still exist. A good local contact can help you navigate through the dangers. Respect local laws, your nation's laws, and your own company's code of contact. </li><li>Despite their frequently explicit communication style, they are not comfortable with public displays of disagreement or conflict in the workplace.

      "body": " <p>Visitors should bear in mind that Ukraine is a young country - not just politically but in terms of business. A distinction can usually be made between older and younger Ukrainians. Those under 40 are ambitious and hard-working and are founding their own businesses and gaining high positions in other organisations. They often speak good English and have a more Western-style approach to business matters. </p> <p>Those who are older have been more influenced by the Soviet style of doing things. They may not be able to speak good English and may need a translator. They will not be so attuned to Western business methods and may be more inflexible and expect visitors to adapt to them. But they should not be underestimated either. If they are in positions of authority or have forged good businesses for themselves, they have achieved a lot. </p> <p>Ukrainians should not be underestimated. If they do not speak good English, that is, of course, not a reflection of their ability. People will resent being talked down to or having things explained to them in very simple terms. Ukrainians are educated and highly motivated. They are great survivors and should be approached with respect. </p>"

      "body": " <p>Ukrainians are outgoing and friendly. They greatly value family and friends and these close bonds have helped them be survivors through the rigours of a troubled past history and some great ordeals. They are also on the way to forging a new and prosperous nation, with one of their goals being EU membership. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Ukra.5;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Ukrainians should be approached with respect and friendliness. The very familiar and robust manner of some Americans or British business people may be too assertive for some of them and may seem overwhelming and perhaps aggressive. They are generally conservative in style and dress. You should show consideration and interest in their country and their history, while avoiding some its more painful episodes. They are fond of wining and dining - though many locals do not have much money to do so, so they appreciate entertainment. Usually the one who is hoping to gain from the relationship will be the host. </p> <p>If you find some aspects of the behaviour and attitudes of the older generation frustrating, remember that they are relatively new to the Western ways of doing business. Any displays of frustration will only cause offence and may cause your business associates to `shut down.' The best approach is to be direct, honest and respectful and to display goodwill to your business counterparts. Younger managers will be share similar attitudes to those in Western businesses. </p> <p>While they expect respect, the Ukrainian way of communication is quite direct and may come across as abrasive to some visitors.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Be prepared to work to build a solid relationship with business partners in Ukraine. When meeting people for the first time, show some appreciation of the country and its history, though it is best to steer clear of some of its troubled, and indeed, tragic past. Keep thoughts about corruption and political problems to yourself unless you are&nbsp;visiting a professional to get specific advice about this area. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Ukra.6;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Shake hands on greeting business associates and saying goodbye. Kissing on greeting and farewells is usually reserved for very close friends and family. Take note that Ukraine shares some superstitions with Russia. One is that shaking hands across a doorway is a sign of bad luck. </p> <p>Be sure to take a good supply of business cards. Have the contents of the card translated into Ukrainian on the reverse side and make sure that this side is shown to your counterpart. When doing business in areas where Russian is spoken frequently, ask your local contact whether it is appropriate to have Russian included on a business card. </p> <p>Ukrainians are mostly straightforward , polite and direct in their communication style. Any overly zealous, aggressive or pushy behaviour on a visitor's part could cause offense. They may, however, be quite abrupt, for example, jumping into negotiations at the deep end rather than building up to discussing matters like price.</p> <p>Gifts are much appreciated and if you are going to someone's home, it is advisable to take something. Something from your own country should be of interest. Ukrainians like sweet things so chocolates or other confectionery are popular. If flowers are taken, make sure that you have an even number, as an odd number is seen as a bad sign. Among friends, gifts for children will be considered especially thoughtful. </p>"

This practice is changing as it is being recognised that working well in advance can be helpful. Be clear about your intentions and goals for the first meeting with people in particular. Be punctual and let your counterparts know if you are going to be late but do not expect them necessarily to be on time. Younger people may be more attuned to Western practices. Be sure that you know whether or not interpreters will be needed, and if so, what languages will be needed - given that Russian is widely spoken in some areas. Factor in more time for a meeting if an interpreter is to be present. Make sure that senior managers are involved - strong leadership is respected in Ukraine and they will expect to be dealing with bosses who can take responsibility and make decisions. </p> <p><strong>During a Meeting </strong></p> <p>Ukrainians will usually start a meeting with small talk, during which they will evaluate their counterparts and put them into context. They may well follow this with an abrupt change of subject, getting straight down to business. Westerners and Asians are often taken by surprise by this approach, for example, declaring the desired outcome (a win for the Ukrainian side) and inviting you to explain how this can be achieved. Do not change your story; keep to it throughout the meeting.</p> <p>Often, Ukrainians will appear to concentrate on what is wrong or what needs to be fixed rather than what is going well, but this is not a sign of negative thinking. It's more a case of if something is going well, there is no need to fix or change it. </p> <p>It is quite standard for minutes to be taken in meetings. Subordinates will often take direction from people of higher rank. Great respect is shown to elders in Ukraine or to those in authority. </p> <p><strong>After a Meeting </strong></p> <p>There may be quite some discussion about what has to be done. You may be asked to sign a confirmation of co-operation, or a Protocol of Intent, like a memo denoting the first stage on the long journey to a contract. You will be expected to stamp this with your company stamp, so be sure to bring one. Usually, such documents are not legally binding but lawyers can advise as to what will be normal in the circumstances and when a more formal agreement should be prepared. </p> <p>The conclusion of a deal may be celebrated with vodka shots, which are downed in one.</p>"

Like Russians, Ukrainians value a sense of ownership and kinship when it comes to their place of employment.
