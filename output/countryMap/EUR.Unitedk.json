The British are hard-working, driven by deadlines and the need for material gain, and divided by an ancient class system, the boundaries of which are blurring but nonetheless still in existence. The British like their privacy but are also obsessed with celebrity culture and gossip. They are sceptical, with a strong sense of irony. The spoken word is a minefield of nuance and understatement for anybody not familiar with British English.</p> <p>Most British people are relatively well-travelled, with a strong awareness of world events. They are individualistic and nationalistic and can be pioneering and entrepreneurial. At the same time, Britons are still considered very polite and formal by the rest of the world, and are driven by a strong sense of fair play.</p>"

British people are nothing like as patriotic as Americans (except, perhaps, at sporting events) but are nonetheless proud to be an island nation with a long and glorious past. <img alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Unitedk.1;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Individual countries which make up Great Britain, however, are highly nationalistic - Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and even pockets of people from Cornwall in the far west.</p> <p>British society is also highly diverse, with many second and third-generation immigrants forming sizeable chunks of the population and ethnic 'minorities' developing a stronger and stronger voice.</p> <p>&nbsp;Despite a high standard of living, the country does not win many awards for actual quality of life.</p>"

Many people are members of clubs and will attend matches on a weekly basis. </li><li>Going to the pub. Britain's pubs are unique. Some are historic, some are themed, but for many, the pub is a second home. New, more liberal licensing hours are only likely to increase this. </li><li>Eating out. Britain's cities have a vast range of restaurants serving every type of cuisine imaginable. London has some of the finest restaurants in the world. </li><li>Going to the gym. Britain has a thriving fitness culture and many people, particularly executives, belong to a gym and attend several times a week. </li><li>Outdoor pursuits. Walking, hiking and fishing are the most popular participation activities in the country. Hunting (which has recently had a partial ban) is only practiced by a tiny minority. </li><li>Golf. Many people belong to a golf club and play regularly. Golf is expensive, but not prohibitively so as it is in Japan, and less elitist than it used to be. </li><li>Cinema and theatre. London is recognised as having the world's finest theatre scene and Britain has many excellent regional theatres as well. Cinema has enjoyed an enormous revival in the last 20 years. </li><li>Travel. The proliferation of low cost airlines in Europe and the Eurostar rail link to the Continent mean the British are highly mobile. Millions take at least one overseas holiday a year, usually two, as well as several short breaks. Britain is currently experiencing a boom in overseas property purchases, too, with thousands currently owning a second home in France, Spain, Cyprus, Greece, Portugal or the USA.</li></ul> </p><p></p>"

      "body": " <p> <ol> <li><img alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Unitedk.3;0.jpg\" align=\"right\" border=\"1\">Be prepared for indirectness in communication. For example, \"May I suggest that . . .\" instead of \"I'd like you to . . .\". This politeness is meant as a courtesy, but can be confusing to someone used to a more direct communication style. Pay attention to tone of voice and facial expression as well as to what is said. </li><li>Expect there to be a high level of humour even in business situations. The humour is often ironic - saying one thing, but meaning another. It can also be self-deprecating as well as sarcastic and cynical. </li><li>Avoid asking too many personal questions about your British counterpart's background, salary, etc. Privacy is valued. Typically, there is a distinction between work and the rest of life. </li><li>Expect the British to value teamwork while also recognising the importance of individual accountability for results. </li><li>Expect the British to have a strong sense of fair play. Typically, they do not appreciate excessive bargaining or changing a deal once it's been agreed on. A win/win approach is favoured. </li><li>Avoid the hard sell in any presentations; it is likely to create distrust and resistance. </li><li>Expect meetings to begin close to the scheduled time. You can also expect meetings to be structured, but not rigidly so. Typically meetings will begin and end with social conversation. </li><li>Expect the British workplace to be relatively informal with an increasingly 'flat' hierarchical structure. First names are used very quickly. There is an increasing emphasis on the manager as a coach who empowers others to make decisions and get things done. </li><li>After-work drinking is common and visitors will be encouraged to join in. This is when your counterparts will really evaluate whether you are the kind of person with whom they want to do business. </li><li>Don't interpret a detached manner as indifference; the British tend not to express subjective feelings enthusiastically (in business).</li></ol> </p><p></p>"

      "body": " <p>In business, the British demonstrate a mixture of relaxation, humour and making time for socialising, combined with extreme pressure and stress. <img alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Unitedk.4;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">They can be both welcoming and aloof, good team players or mavericks, and will often say the exact opposite of what they mean and expect you to understand.</p> <p>Charisma and entrepreneurial spirit are admired, although flashiness and insincerity meet with instant distrust. In meetings, the British prefer harmony to confrontation, which embarrasses them.</p> <p>The British are target-driven with a short-term outlook, but prefer to cultivate long-term relationships, so it is worth making the effort to socialise in the pub after work and get to know people. A good command of English is important, as the British are generally relatively poor at learning other languages and using them.</p>"

Trying to emulate this probably won't work, but being prepared not to take the British too literally does help.</p> <p>Don't make a gushing and effusive presentation. A lively presentation is good, but the British do not trust anybody too sugary - they will hold them in suspicion instead. The same goes for boasting about one's credentials, or the opposite extreme of apologising for everything, which will make the British feel uncomfortable.</p> <p>Dress smartly but with individuality. A garish or ironic tie is not out of place in many environments.</p>"

      "title": "Business Etiquette",
      "body": " <p>The British are masters of understatement, with irony a favourite weapon, where a direct question may encounter an evasive response. Another typically British ploy is to avoid stating the obvious and to imply the opposite of what is actually said. Tone of voice or facial expression may hint at what is really meant. This takes the term \"reading between the lines\" one stage further - it is as important to pay attention to what is not said as to what is.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Unitedk.6;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Do not underestimate the importance of humour in business discussions - a repertoire of jokes and anecdotes can be a real asset. If they come naturally to you, then make good use of them. In any case do not be taken aback by any seemingly inappropriate light-heartedness. The British are also prone to using sarcasm, particularly the one-line dig, to ridicule an adversary or to register disagreement or contempt. Aggressive 'hard sell' techniques or denigrating another company's product or service are unlikely to be appreciated. Nor should you give unsolicited gushing praise, since excessive enthusiasm is rarely welcome. Once they decide they want to do business with you, the British are capable of being blunt and direct.</p> <p>Britain has a deeply ingrained class system and while it's bad form to discuss this, and many consider the system completely irrelevant in the 21st century, visitors are still likely to be judged on their social skills and manners.</p> <p><b>Business cards</b></p> <p>Increasingly, business cards do not indicate a manager's academic credentials. Name and job title are essential, but a list of qualifications, such as 'MBA', can be perceived as 'showing off'. Business cards are exchanged at the beginning or end of a meeting. There is no particular etiquette governing their presentation or display on the table during a meeting; Asian visitors, who value the ritual exchange of cards, should try not to be offended if a British manager stuffs a card into his or her pocket soon after receiving it.</p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>The British are not tactile. They often display discomfort with perceivably intimate physical contact such as kissing, hugging, back-slapping or touching in a formal situation. Such actions are for close friends and family only. Men and women, and women and women do exchange air kisses if they know each other well enough, but not on the first meeting. Do not stand too close to a British person when addressing them, or put your hand on their arm to make a point, as they may shrink away feeling uncomfortable. The British are very territorial about their personal space, whether it's their desk, their car or their seat on the London Underground.</p> <p>Gestures are used sparingly and emotions are kept in check in a business environment, although being so laid back as to talk with your hands in your pockets is considered very rude. Losing one's cool is not a good idea as the British will be embarrassed - a 'stiff upper lip' is best.</p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>British managers tend to be focused, informed, pragmatic and rational in their communication style, although their language is often characterised by indirectness, imprecision, and unwillingness to 'say it as it is'. The British are comfortable with open-ended questions. The British communication style tends to blur reality and experience but it makes for more interesting listening. British managers have a subjective rather than objective view of their jobs, organisations, industries and company culture.</p> <p>As a general rule, British managers prefer not to engage in open verbal conflict. Harmony in meetings and discussions is important. If conflict is needed, it will be 'managed'. Because the British have a preference for avoiding conflict, they use a range of mechanisms to control situations that might produce open conflict. The use of implied language: \"Perhaps we could consider some other options\", really meaning \"I don't like your ideas\", and humour as a tool to defuse tension, are characteristics of British management dialogue. If somebody says something is 'quite good', it probably means they really don't like it at all. Irony is used frequently.</p> <p>British people will not generally talk loudly to one another in public. Manners are very important and 'please' and 'thank you' are frequently used in the workplace.</p> <p><b>Gift giving</b></p> <p>Exchanging of gifts between clients or suppliers is generally discouraged on a personal level. Some companies have policies forbidding such practices because they place undue pressure on employees when making commercial decisions. Civil servants (government workers) are not allowed to receive gifts at all.</p> <p>Conversely, corporate hospitality (inviting clients and suppliers to sporting or cultural events) is widespread. The British corporate entertainment industry is worth millions, with companies often taking a box at a rugby match, for example, and plying customers with drinks and fine foods.</p>"

      "body": " <p>British meetings aim to be pragmatic and exist primarily for sharing information and opinions and making <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Unitedk.7;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">decisions. Meetings should be productive; those that merely evolve around general discussion are seen as a waste of time. Such meetings are, however, frequently encountered, because of the collaborative style of the British workplace. Most managers would prefer fewer meetings, but this is difficult when trying to create an inclusive workplace.</p> <p>British managers may not spend a great deal of time preparing for a meeting. Managers are often happy to 'wing it', which means responding to a situation without preparing for it thoroughly. This is a classic British management trait. Successfully 'winging it' is a greatly admired attribute. You, on the other hand, as a visitor, are expected to prepare thoroughly and have presentation materials and facts at your fingertips.</p> <p>Meetings usually follow an agenda and will often not finish until all the points on the agenda have been addressed.</p> <p><b>Planning a meeting</b></p> <p>Notify people in writing where and when the meeting will take place and circulate an agenda. If you are presenting during the meeting, make sure any equipment you will need will be supplied and test it beforehand. Prepare handouts for distribution after the meeting/presentation.</p> <p>Many large companies are set up for videoconferencing, which is an acceptable way to hold a meeting. Conference calls by phone are also very common and may be a quicker way of assembling a group of busy people.</p> <p><b>During a Meeting</b></p> <p>A chairman leads the meeting, usually the most senior person there, or the person who has called the meeting. A secretary is appointed to take the minutes at a formal meeting; otherwise, it's up to the attendees to make their own notes. The agenda is followed, although there are often deviations and interruptions and at times, chaos as everybody exercises their democratic right to speak. People will take calls on their mobile phones in meetings, and may come and go during the course of the meeting, which can be unsettling.</p> <p><b>Following a meeting</b></p> <p>The minutes of a formal meeting will be circulated to all who were present for approval. If there are no minutes, it is a good idea to follow up with a letter or email, reiterating what was discussed and concluded. If consensus was reached, make sure the decision has been signed off by the relevant senior person. If more work needs to be done, circulate a 'to do' memo and make sure you know who is doing what.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Their international colleagues frequently describe British managers as confident presenters, with a natural flair for marketing ideas to an audience. This is because British managers often appear more <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Unitedk.9;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">comfortable presenting in English compared to non-native English speakers, who may lack confidence despite a better technical understanding. Many companies now recognise the importance of presenter training and will pay for senior executives to attend courses. This is especially true at chief executive level, where the CEO has to chair potentially controversial shareholder events like annual general meetings.</p> <p>The British place more emphasis on style over substance,&nbsp;but as a rule favour a less extroverted and flamboyant style than many&nbsp;American executives when in a presentation.&nbsp;Realism, clarity and avoiding unnecessary detail are all appreciated by a British audience.</p> <p><b>Presentation Essentials</b></p> <p>It's important to pitch a presentation correctly to a British audience. A hard sell is not appreciated. Nor is gushing praise for anything, exaggerated claims, or denigrating the competition (although this does happen in internal presentations). Do not be put off if people are doodling or looking out of the window during your talk; they are probably still taking it in.</p> <p>While the British look to form long-term relationships, they are interested in quick results, so any sales pitch must emphasise the immediate benefits. Back up your sales pitch with analysis and figures; the British want to see real benefits, not just hype and novelty.</p> <p><b>Audience Expectations</b></p> <p>Not all British audiences have a very good attention span, so start by saying how long you are planning to speak for and what you are planning to cover, and summarise this in a single slide at the end. It is normal to allow questions at the end of a presentation. British audiences essentially start listening to a presentation from a negative position and are not easily whipped up into a frenzy of enthusiasm, so keep the presentation measured, interesting and throw in a few touches of humour or drama to wake them up and make them pay attention. A large audience at a public event like an AGM (Annual&nbsp;General Meeting)&nbsp;will not hesitate to voice its displeasure, as many a chief executive has found to his or her cost. Humour is better avoided in these situations.</p> <p>The occasional controversial statement should provoke a reaction after the presentation. There may be reticence in starting the questions, so be prepared to start by asking yourself a rhetorical question. When someone asks a question, listen to the question and talk to them, not at them, or you will be perceived as insincere.</p>"

Companies spend a great deal of money on customer acquisition and retention. On the other hand, when things go wrong, consumers' legal rights are constantly invoked. British customers expect good treatment and will become aggressive and litigious when they feel they are not getting it. Any company wanting to do business in Britain must be aware of this culture.</p>"
