Despite their natural openness, they are not given to great displays of emotion. They are known for being sensitive to criticism and for being strong-willed. Correspondingly, they are also noted for having a very robust sense of humour. </p> <p>Although Norway is old in terms of human habitation, it is a young nation politically. Having struggled to attain their political independence in 1905, Norwegians are very proud of their heritage. Many are staunch nationalists and supporters of justice and democracy. </p> <p>Norwegians are pragmatic, egalitarian and very direct speakers - which can take some people by surprise. They are prone to be bigger risk-takers than some of their neighbours, more spontaneous and also very energetic. While they speak their mind, they also try to avoid conflict. Once Vikings, the Norwegian's are now peacemakers. Influenced no doubt by the harsh conditions of their homeland, they are a self-reliant people, and strong Protestant traditions still prevail. Norwegians enjoy one of the highest standards of living in Europe. </p> <p>Norwegians have very close ties to Britain, their neighbour across the sea. Both are seagoing, trading, democratic monarchies with a love of the outdoors and a shared sense of humour. </p>"

After suffering real privations after the Second World War, <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Norw.1;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Norwegians have enjoyed great prosperity in recent decades boosted by the development of the oil industry. Economic prosperity helped Norway expand its social welfare services and the Norwegians now live in an affluent, well-ordered society. While the standard of living used to be expensive in comparison to other European countries, there has been a leveling-off in the last two decades. </p> <p>Norway's population is concentrated around the warmer south east. There are many small, rural communities all along the west coast where mail and supplies are still delivered every day by boat. </p> <p>The Norwegians come from very ancient stock. The country's history has engendered a great sense of independence and self-reliance in its people. They have twice rejected proposals for joining the European Union. Their great respect for justice, democracy and strong values have resulted from the country's Protestant Christianity. They are however, seen by some of their neighbours as being somewhat distant and stubborn. </p> <p>The Norwegians have a love of tradition and are strong-minded but are also fairly progressive. While the country is sparsely populated, it also has thriving cities. Norwegians are pragmatic and egalitarian and greater risk-takers than some of their near neighbours. Their characteristics can seem at times contradictory. While they are traditional and family-orientated they have a high divorce rate and a high rate of co-habitation. While they seem to be reserved, they are very direct and frank at the same time. </p> <p>Norway is noted for its great physical beauty which its people love - as exemplified in the music of one of their most notable sons, the composer Edvard Grieg. They also have a passion for sport. Many Norwegians have a second home or holiday home - called a hytte. Norway also has long standing traditions in the arts - especially in music and literature, and in traditional folk arts. </p>"

      "body": " <p>The Norwegians have been noted for being thrifty. More recently however, and especially with the development of the economy in the last several decades, they have become greater spenders. Home ownership is a priority for most people and this is one of their most fundamental motivators. Due to the <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Norw.2;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">sometimes harsh nature of their environment and also the financial hardship experienced following the Second World War, Norwegians are very self-reliant. Although there are good public services like education and health services, Norwegians still feel responsible for themselves. Interest rates have also been low for some time which has encouraged people to buy property. In addition, many people - around 30% - own a second or holiday home, although this may be a fairly modest dwelling in the forest.</p> <p>Most schools and hospitals are publicly owned and run and Norwegians in general enjoy a very high standard of living. The latest United Nations Human Development Index - which takes account of matters like education and prosperity - ranked Norway number one in the world. </p> <p>Norwegians work slightly different hours to those in other countries - usually from 8 am to 4 pm with an early lunch break from 11 or 11.30 am for only half an hour or so. Those in larger companies and multinationals, however, may work longer hours. People generally like to leave work on time and get home so that they have some time to themselves and with their family - which remains an important factor in local life. Norwegians strive for a good work / home life balance. Many Norwegians love the outdoors, are keen skiers and travellers. Summer holidays are taken in June / July. There is a great passion for sport but Norwegians have also a distinguished heritage in the arts - especially literature and music - and in traditional arts and crafts. </p> <p>The Norwegians are believed by some to be heavy drinkers, but this is not often the case nowadays. Alcohol is hugely expensive. The one million Norwegians living close to the Swedish border spend $100 million a year on alcohol in Swedish shops and smuggling is a flourishing trade for organised crime. </p> <p>Off-sales that is, sales to customers outside a bar, are controlled by the state-run Vinmonopolets. Anything stronger than a light beer can only be sold by the Vinmonopolet. That means wine, whiskey, brandy and liqueurs. Drinking habits are changing.. The consumption of wine increased over 600% from 1970 until 2001, which is a world record. During this period, the consumption of spirits has been halved. In terms of total alcohol consumption, Norway is at the bottom in Europe.</p>"

The key to having a successful partnership is to build it over time on the basis of mutual trust and positive experiences of working together. Norwegian companies will switch suppliers readily if they feel they can get a better deal, so do not place too much faith in your relationship if you cannot deliver.</p> <p>Norwegians' sense of independence should also be recognised. They are forthright and to the point and will not necessarily engage in the sort of personal conversation that may be undertaken elsewhere. They can also be spontaneous and impulsive, once you break through their shyness. They may not go over things in so much detail as others in the Nordic region before making a decision. </p> <p>The Norwegians are well-educated and affluent and although they are modernists and progressive in their views, they are also inherently traditional with a great respect for personal freedom and family. They are famously independent and employees are used to being given much responsibility and not being micro-managed. They like consensus and avoid conflict and confer regularly, sharing information between themselves. They are also egalitarian - women enjoy a very strong position in society, both in politics and in business. Promotion is usually based on merit - who you know is not so important here though building respect among colleagues and associates will stand you in good stead. </p>"

That being said, they also have a pleasant and relaxed demeanor and are not overly formal. Like other Scandinavians, they are straightforward and honest. They will have no time for duplicitous or devious behaviour which could destroy goodwill. They are not accustomed to people having ulterior motives. A soft spoken, friendly and efficient manner is the most appropriate way to conduct yourself.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Norw.5;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">During business dealings, it is important to be honest and direct and to be willing to share information regularly. Norwegians respect and expect reliability and an ability to effectively deliver what is promised. Self-motivated people are also valued in Norway. Women in Norway are highly active in business and in politics and enjoy a powerful position in society which should be acknowledged and respected - sexist behaviour or comments are entirely inappropriate.</p> <p>Norwegians are proud patriots and will appreciate those who have a knowledge and understanding of their history and culture. A willingness to talk about their country and find out more about it will earn admiration. Good topics of conversation include their great outdoors and their food. Be careful about praising their neighbours too much - Scandinavian countries enjoy friendly rivalry and will often make jokes about one another, but visitors should listen and laugh where appropriate, rather than making jokes of their own on the subject.</p> <p>Overbearing or boastful behavior will be frowned upon. Norway is a small country in terms of population and word about business associates can get around quickly. Undue extravagance will also not generate respect. </p>"

      "body": " <p>Norwegians are not given to great displays of emotion. They are very fond of shaking hands. People who are unacquainted will shake hands when meeting and exchange their full names. Friends will also shake hands when meeting and parting. Women are well respected in Norway and there is great observance of gender equality so little distinction is made between greeting men and women. If someone is seated when others arrive it is considered polite to stand for introductions. Norwegians will expect to see a well-presented business card but there is no particular etiquette regarding exchanging cards.</p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Norw.6;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Norwegians are modest and low-key and loud or flamboyant behaviour is not well received. They are not very physically demonstrative so physically expressive mannerisms like those in some Latin American countries are not the norm. Visitors should be wary of physical contact like touching arms or backs during conversations; it will make a Norwegian feel uncomfortable. Reading body language can be difficult because of the lack of gestures. Don't fix somebody with a gaze for too long - they will think it's a sexual advance, or an aggressive approach.</p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>Norwegians are also direct and honest and will expect people to communicate frankly and get to the point without much ado. Though they are reasonably shy, they are also very pragmatic and more emphasis will be put on verbal communication rather than large amounts of paperwork. Their speech is brisk and can sound strident although this is not intended. </p> <p>When written communication is needed, email and fax are used extensively, rather than letters. </p> <p><b>Gift giving</b></p> <p>Presenting gifts is not a required part of doing business in the country although taking a small and appropriate gift to someone's house is seen as a polite and friendly gesture. The only kind of gift which is acceptable and won't be construed as a bribe is a small but tasteful token from one's own country. The Norwegians are known to be thrifty so anything very expensive or extravagant may be out of place. Alcohol however, is welcomed at a dinner party as it's extremely expensive in Norway. It's also common to celebrate the conclusion of a deal with brandy or champagne.</p>"

Remember that the business day in many organisations ends quite early at around 4 pm. Lunch is quite early - often from 11.00 to 11.30. Meetings are welcomed as the Norwegians like to reach agreement and settle matters with others through discussion and consensus. The Norwegians are not generally authoritarian; managers will also include several associates in meetings to broaden the discussion, though they may not be from the most junior level. If you are negotiating during the meeting, expect your Norwegian counterparts to have the decision makers in place in the room from the beginning.</p> <p>A meeting will usually follow an agenda. </p> <p><b>During a meeting</b></p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Norw.7;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Norwegians do not like to indulge in much small talk before getting down to business. Some casual and friendly comments - for instance on recent news, on Norway's attributes or on sports events - will be welcome. Humour is always appreciated although you should obviously be politically correct when you don't know people. Coffee and pastries will usually be served at a meeting.</p> <p>Allow your Norwegian hosts to lead discussions. The Norwegian style of address often seems very direct but the Norwegians are frank and look to have purposeful conversation. Brisk, strident-sounding speech does not mean somebody is being combative. They are good listeners but tend to form opinions very quickly, after which their opinions are hard to change. </p> <p>Norwegians are friendly and open and will expect others to be so too. Do not play mind games or use sarcasm, as neither will win you respect. Be prepared for meetings with any necessary supporting material, facts and figures. The Norwegians are not only pragmatic but highly educated and will expect others to be prepared and informed, particularly when it comes to the bottom line.</p> <p>Interruptions and calls on mobile phones in a meeting are considered rude and should be avoided.</p> <p><b>After the meeting</b></p> <p>Meetings will be expected to have an outcome and to be efficiently conducted. Go over what has been discussed and agreed to at the end of a meeting and remember that your word is your bond. Reneging on a decision or agreement, even if it was only verbal, is considered bad form. Reneging on a written agreement is even worse.</p> <p>Agree on what has to be done by others afterwards and make sure that matters for action are dealt with. Minutes may be circulated to a large number of people in order for consensus to be achieved. </p>"

Performance is now often linked to bonus schemes. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Norw.8;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Personal freedom and space is important to Norwegians. They are self-focused and independent. They are keen home owners and also take their personal time and family seriously. Many own second homes in the country and like to enjoy to the outdoors regularly. Some companies also provide company holiday homes which are available to staff. Working hours are somewhat different from elsewhere. Norwegians take a very early, often short lunch break and many factories and offices close at 4 pm. Norwegians like to get home to spend some time with family at the end of the day. They live in a very affluent society with a good social welfare system, but have a strong work ethic and do not take state support for granted. </p> <p>Employers should take these national characteristics into account. At work they are also self-reliant and do not like to be tightly managed but are used to having tasks readily delegated to them. They also expect free and positive consultation and to work as a part of a team. Any personal criticism should be carefully considered and communicated in a positive way and preferably alone.

Humour is appreciated; the Norwegians feel a close affinity with its neighbour Britain, and its sense of humour. They will assess arguments objectively and presentations should include a good range of facts and figures to support any case. Avoid any hard sell tactics or putting any members of the audience in a difficult position. </p> <p>Norwegians can be stubborn and can form quick opinions while listening to a presentation. Allow the audience the chance to ask questions and make comments after the presentation. Do not interrupt when people are speaking as this is seen as bad manners. Be prepared for members of the audience to be forthright in their views. Answers should be given in a friendly, supportive and businesslike manner. Presenters should evaluate what particular aspects of their business and arguments will appeal to Norwegians and should be well versed about their history, and their economy.

They are also not given to confrontation and may avoid discussing a problem that could lead to personal conflict. Any criticism should be made in a positive, supportive way and preferably not in front of others. When dealing with employees, outsiders should remember that the Norwegians are noted for having a very `fresh' and direct style of speech that can be seen by others as quite blunt; this should not be interpreted as rudeness.</p>"
