Many Argentines believe Buenos Aires to be the cultural counterpart of Paris. They are proud of the size and beauty of their country and like visitors to appreciate it. History and traditions are highly valued.</p> <p>The most honoured group in Argentine culture is the extended family from which the individual gains his or her self-identity. The family's status power and welfare comes first. Protecting one's honour is of critical importance. </p> <p>Argentine stereotypes tend to be based on the Porte?, or native of Buenos Aires, and include perceived preoccupations with football, politics and fast living. The images of sultry tango dancers and riders on prancing horses are further stereotypes but are less justified. If Argentines had a choice they would want their stereotype to be of a gaucho, the near-mythical plainsman who is independent and brave, athletic, a bold warrior, loyal and generous. The gaucho is the idealised version of a complex historical figure who has become etched into the Argentine consciousness. Modern Argentines believe that they have incorporated the values associated with the gaucho into their own system.</p> <p>The Church and state are officially separate, but about 90% of the population considers itself Roman Catholic. Jews and Protestants account for about 2% each. There tends to be a conflict among the forces of feeling, faith and facts. Argentines often look at problems from a subjective perspective but these feelings are usually influenced by faith in an ideology (primarily the Catholic Church, or that of a political party).</p> "

Once Argentina became an independent nation immigrants from all over Europe, including; the Spanish, Italian, English, Irish, German, Polish, Jewish and Ukranian were encouraged to come to Argentina. Immigrants today are more likely to be from the Pacific Rim. Britain has strong historical ties with Argentina. English is widely spoken and British customs, habits and fashions are appreciated. Many families have curiously English or Irish-sounding surnames, like O'Brien.</p> <p><img height=\"150\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$SoAm.Arge.1;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">About 85% of Argentines are of European descent, primarily Spanish or Italian. Indians, mestizos (people of mixed Indian and Spanish ancestry), and black people together make up only 15% of Argentina's population. </p> <p>Buenos Aires has the largest number of Jews in Latin America; they are commonly referred to as los rusos (the Russians) because most of the early Jewish settlers emigrated from Czarist Russia.</p> <p>Argentina is a huge country with great stretches of wilderness. About 90% of the population lives in urban areas with much of the remaining 10% involved in farming or ranching. The population of Buenos Aires is 12 million of whom 85% are of European descent. In the countryside, about 150,000 gauchos (Argentine cowboys) tend 55 million cattle, 30 million sheep and two million horses.</p> <p>Families are not especially large nowadays (2.19 children on average) but family ties are strong and children will often live at home well into adulthood and until they get married. The elderly are treated with respect and cared for as part of the family unit.</p> <p>Despite a strong recovery the economic and political crisis of 2001/02 has left its mark in Argentina, particularly in the form of increased inequality and poverty. With around 35% of the population living below the poverty line there are occasional outbreaks of social unrest and demonstrations which at times, turn violent.</p>"

      "body": " <p>In Buenos Aires, life revolves around caf?society, late nights, opera, football, and for many, dancing. Evenings become active very late; dinner may not start until 9.30pm, followed by a club. For those with <img height=\"220\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$SoAm.Arge.2;0.jpg\" width=\"165\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">money, the social scene in the city is stylish and sophisticated with a very European feel.</p> <p>Family ties are very important and weekends and holidays are often spent in large family groups.</p> <p>Domestic tourism has benefited recently as previously wealthy Argentines can no longer afford trips to their traditional holiday destinations of Miami, Brazil and the Dominican Republic. There are therefore, numerous opportunities to relax in resorts, as well as pursue sports like riding, mountaineering and hiking. Although Argentines are primarily city dwellers there is a growing industry in outdoors and adventure tourism, and many people are only just beginning to discover their own country. </p> <p>Top leisure activities include: <ul> <li>Football (futbol), both watching and playing. </li><li>Polo - Argentina produces some of the best polo players and ponies in the world. </li><li>Horse racing, rugby and tennis. </li><li>Tango - although this may seem something of a clich? Buenos Aires is the tango capital of the world and many Argentines enjoy dancing. </li><li>Jazz. </li><li>Opera. </li><li>Eating at restaurants and socialising in cafes.</li></ul> </p><p></p>"

Approach business meetings and negotiations as a partner.

When a relationship has been built, hugs, slaps on the back, and kisses can be expected. </li><li>Greet most people in your business dealings with their title and surname. Titles can include Doctor (Ph.D or physician), Profesor (teacher), Ingeniero (engineer) or Abrogado (lawyer). </li><li>Be prepared for a lengthy decision making process involving several organisational layers. </li><li>Dress conservatively - dark suits and ties for men; white blouses and dark suits or skirts for women. </li><li>Don't be surprised if your business meeting is at 8 pm. Argentine executives often put in very long days. Be on time, but be prepared to wait 30 minutes for your counterpart. </li><li>Be prepared to present a serious, intelligent, articulate argument combined with a friendly approach. </li><li>Make appointments through a third party - an enchufado - who has contacts within an industry. Prior appointments are necessary. </li><li>Take time for small talk and business entertaining. Argentines are tough negotiators who do not make concessions quickly or easily. Good relations will shorten negotiations. </li><li>Be prepared for lengthy and detailed contracts rather than verbal agreements. </li></ol> </p><p></p>"

      "body": " <p>Despite the&nbsp;past incidences&nbsp;of corruption at high levels, Argentines are considered to be charming, honourable and rewarding to work with. They are intelligent, well spoken and well-mannered, with pride and honour being two of the most valued personality traits. In Buenos Aires, with about 85% of European <img height=\"142\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$SoAm.Arge.4;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">descent, people have a distinctly European outlook. There is a national inclination towards soul-searching coupled with a melancholic aura, which adds to the general Argentine charm.</p> <p>Personal relationships are very important in business and it is essential to build a network of contacts. Information is not readily shared thus networking is the best way to learn about the local scene. Business entertaining is a way of life in Buenos Aires. Expect late nights and lavish meals.</p> <p>Businesses have a strong vertical hierarchy with decision-making from the top, so it is important to be dealing with the right person. Bosses tend to be autocratic and paternalistic and Argentine managers, anxious to hold onto what power they have are not inclined to delegate. Negotiations can therefore be slow and protracted. Meetings are often used as a forum for debate with different ideas being aired. </p>"

      "body": " <p>Even if your counterpart speaks Spanish as his or her first language, be aware that the person may have a mixture of cultural influences - Italian, German, English, French, Russian. The ancestors of Argentina's former president - Carlos Saul Menem - were from Syria. Give some consideration to learning some Spanish. A few phrases will be appreciated.</p> <p><img height=\"137\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$SoAm.Arge.5;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Always address an Argentine formally, using his or her title and family name (next to last name). A Ph D or a physician is called Doctor. Teachers prefer the title Professor, engineers go by Ingeiero, architects are Arquitecto, and lawyers are Abogado. Maintain formality in dress, posture and speech until your counterpart relaxes the interaction. Your image is important in communicating your own status. A very British reserve, complete with formality of dress and manner, is characteristic of many Argentines.</p> <p>Try to avoid offering any political/religious opinions. Be especially cautious about praising Argentina's neighbors (especially Chile). Argentina has fought wars with all of them. Do not criticize the country's political and economic track record unless you really know your counterpart well.</p> <p>Most Argentines are anxious to put the Falkland Islands war behind them, so avoid bringing the subject up. If it is discussed, however, refer to the islands by their Argentine name, the Malvinas Islands.</p> <p>Argentines appreciate compliments about their children and the meal, and they like to talk about the beauty of local parks and gardens and their country.</p> <p>Talking about sports is always a good way to open a conversation. Soccer (called futbol) is the most popular sport. American football is futbol americano. Horse racing, rugby, tennis, and polo are also popular. The tango originated in Argentina, and many Argentines appreciate American jazz.</p> <p>Many Argentines love opera, so this is a good topic to discuss. Buenos Aires is on the world's opera circuit and the Colon is one of the finest opera houses in the world. Restaurants and sightseeing are also good topics.</p>"

      "body": " <p><b>Business cards</b></p> <p>There is no formal custom surrounding the exchange of business cards, but it is good idea to have an ample supply. Have business cards translated into Spanish on the reverse side if you have a complicated title.</p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>Close male friends shake hands or embrace upon meeting; men kiss close female friends. Close female friends usually kiss each other. The full embrace (abrazo) may entail a hug, a handshake and several thumps on the shoulder, ending with another handshake.</p> <p>Maintaining eye contact is very important, even when the person is standing very close. Don't back away. Although many Argentines demonstrate an almost British reserve they will hold a conversation at a closer distance than British people or Americans (often with a hand on the other person's lapel or shoulder). A pat on the shoulder is a sign of friendship. </p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>The style of communication in Argentina is polite, assertive, formal, serious, and often apparently argumentative. Personal relationships are important and discussion is better than e-mail correspondence.</p> <p>Argentines, especially those from Buenos Aires, have a reputation for seriousness and melancholy. To call someone or something 'not serious' is a major insult. Maintain formality during initial meetings until your Argentine counterpart relaxes. </p> <p>Even if your counterpart speaks Spanish as his or her first language, be aware that the person may have a mixture of cultural influences - Italian, German, English, French or Russian. The ancestors of the former Argentine president, Carlos Saul Menem, were from Syria. </p> <p>Written communication is implicit and rather stylised and wordy. You may have to learn to read between the lines.</p> <p><b>Gift giving</b></p> <p>Gifts are usually exchanged once a relationship has been established. Tasteful office accessories such as pens or desktop items are good business gifts. Alternatively, the price of imported liquor in Argentina makes this a very welcome gift.</p> <p>Avoid gifts from other countries that are also produced locally, such as wine. Avoid gifts with your company's logo. If invited to an Argentine's home, flowers or chocolates for the host are an acceptable gift. </p>"

      "body": " <p><b>Planning a meeting</b></p> <p>It is wise to make your first appointment in Argentina via an enchufado - an individual who has high level contacts in your industry segment. Make an appointment by phone or email and reconfirm it before you arrive. You could also take a chance - Argentines are used to people dropping in without phoning first. If the person isn't in, a note can be left.</p> <p>Although you may be meeting with people who speak English, give some consideration to learning Spanish. A few phrases will be appreciated. </p> <p>The first meeting is always to establish whether you like each other enough to take things further, so do not expect instant results.</p> <p><b>During a meeting</b></p> <p>Don't expect to get down to business straight away. Expect to begin and end with polite small talk. You can insult Argentine executives by rushing off without chatting at the end of a meeting.</p> <p>Visitors are expected to be punctual but do not be surprised if your Argentine counterpart is late. In general, the more important a person is, the more likely it is that they will be late. Subordinates may arrive first at the meeting with the boss making an entrance afterwards.</p> <p>The use of facts and figures to persuade your Argentine counterparts will only be successful if they do not contradict either feelings or faith. Either way, expect an animated exchange of ideas often with everybody talking at once. Even during an argument, it is unlikely that a subordinate will contradict their boss, or that a boss will disparage something prepared by a subordinate. </p> <p>Frequent interruptions are possible and people do not consider it rude to take calls on their mobile phone during a meeting.</p> <p><b>After a meeting</b></p> <p>It is not unusual for a meeting to continue over lunch, during which your counterpart will continue to assess you and quiz you on politics, culture and your family. They want to get a complete picture of you before entering into negotiations.</p> <p>Follow up meetings with a polite letter of thanks and summary of what was discussed. </p>"

      "body": " <p>Do not be afraid to display a passion for a product or an idea. Argentines are emotional people and will respond to this. It is also acceptable to talk about possible downfalls in a project. Argentines can be fatalistic and sometimes pessimistic and will view something with suspicion if it appears too positive.</p> <p>Remember that you are being judged as an individual, not just a representative of your company. Dress smartly and make sure any handouts and visual aids are professional-looking and pleasing to the eye. Be fully prepared, and practice your speech so that you come across as articulate and fluent. </p> <p>Maintain eye contact with the audience and appear friendly but professional. If there is someone in the room who is obviously senior make more eye contact with them than with the other attendees. </p> <p><b>Audience expectations</b></p> <p>Argentines can become distracted and a speaker will have to be extremely charismatic to hold the attention of an audience for a long time. In smaller, more informal presentations, the audience expects to be allowed to interrupt and ask questions and will often go off at a tangent as new ideas are explored.</p>"

It is important for a manager not to be seen to be doing something menial. </p> <p>Those lower down the hierarchy are often deprived of information and will turn to their co-workers rather than to a superior if a problem needs to be solved. Asking a superior is an admission that they have not understood something and could reflect badly on the manager.</p> <p>Delivering feedback is not an inherent part of Argentine business culture. Positive feedback is appreciated, but anything too effusive will be regarded with suspicion. Negative feedback should be given with great care, i.e. indirectly and being careful to avoid assigning blame; Argentines like to save face. If there is a problem, the person whose problem it is should be given a chance to sort it out before resorting to direct confrontation.</p>"
