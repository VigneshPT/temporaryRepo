They are relatively low-key and not given to strong emotions or nationalist bravado. While their cultural history is long and rich, their nationhood is relatively new. They were founding members of the European Union and are amongst its most enthusiastic supporters, yet they suffer tensions at home due to the divide between the Flemish and the Wallonian regions, which works against the forging of a strong national identity. </p> <p>Belgians are conservative and pragmatic. They prefer to avoid confrontation and are not dogmatic. The Dutch-speaking Flemish are known to be more egalitarian and relaxed while the French-speaking Walloons are more Latin in temperament and more conscious of class and rank. </p>"

They were fearsome enemies of the Romans but were conquered by Julius Caesar and were then ruled by Rome. Later, they were subject to the rule of many others - the <img height=\"133\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Belg.1;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Franks, Burgundians, the Spanish, Austrians and the French. In 1830, Belgium became an independent, constitutional monarchy. </p> <p>Belgium was occupied in World Wars I and II by the Germans. Its more recent history has been dominated by the ongoing tension between the Dutch-speaking inhabitants of Flanders in the north of the country and the French-speaking inhabitants of Wallonia in the south. Constitutional amendments have resulted in the country now being a federation comprising three regions - Flanders, Wallonia and the capitial region of Brussels. The linguistic and cultural divide is much in evidence in working life, education and politics. </p> <p>While the Belgians are hard-working, well-educated and industrious, they also enjoy the good life and eating and drinking are favourite pastimes - justifiably as they produce some of the world's best food, chocolate and beer. </p>"

They are committed Europeans and enjoy the benefits of having the EU headquartered in their country. Belgians enjoy the good life and are bon vivants. They have a lively cafe society and <img height=\"137\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Belg.2;0.jpg\" width=\"210\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">enjoy it to the full. Socialising, drinking and eating out are beloved national past times, as is sport. But Belgians are also conservative and pragmatic. While they enjoy all the fruits of their hard work and economic success, they are traditional and serious-minded too and have one of the highest production rates in the world. A main aim of many Belgians is to own their own home which has led to the local saying that Belgians 'have a brick in their belly.' With one of the highest population densities in Europe, renovation of old homes is becoming increasingly popular and has led to the revival of some inner areas of old cities. </p> <p>There are many opportunities for Belgians to indulge in their love of a good life: the country has some of the best food in Europe; it makes over 450 kinds of beer; it has a rich cultural history and fine museums and arts centres abound. Belgians are keen on the theatre, music and film and there are many outlets for these various forms of art. </p> <p>Belgians have enviable standards of education - the country has one of the highest levels of education in Europe and school is compulsory until the age of 18. Most parents are keen for their children to attain the best qualifications they can in order to find good employment. </p>"

The Walloons can also be sensitive about being seen as quieter versions of the French. Be careful not to speak French to Flemings or Dutch to Walloons.

      "body": " <p>It is completely normal to exchange business cards when meeting in business surroundings in Belgium. It is a good idea to have the French - or Dutch equivalents - of the information on your card on its reverse side, according to the region you are visiting. It may also be worthwhile to have two cards printed so that you have one with <img height=\"133\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Belg.6;0.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">the French translation and another with the Dutch translation. Present the business card with the translated side up so that your counterpart does not miss it. </p> <p>It is customary to shake hands when greeting someone and if meeting a group, shake hands with everyone. Make eye contact when shaking hands. Although Belgian associates will often greet each other with a kiss, you should not presume to do so until you know the person very well and you are sure of your ground. It is also normal to maintain at least an arm's length distance from people with whom you are talking. Maintain good posture and do not keep your hands in your pockets or assume a very relaxed pose, which may be seen as lacking in decorum. Do not presume to pat anyone on the back or put your arm around them. Yawning, using toothpicks or chewing gum in public is also not done. </p> <p>It is not usual to give or receive gifts in business surroundings. But if you wish to celebrate a special occasion - like the closure of a deal - it is advisable to select something which will be personally appealing to the recipient of the gift and something of good quality. Something from your homeland is also appropriate - artifacts or books or some liquor which is a specialty of your country or region. If you receive a gift it is polite to open it in front of the giver and show due appreciation. If you are entertained, you can reciprocate. </p> <p>Belgians rarely invite business associates into their homes but if they do, a gift will be appreciated. Since the Belgians make some of the best chocolates in the world, something else - like flowers - will be preferable. Check with a florist if there are any flowers which are not well received. A thank-you call or note after you have been entertained is also considered polite. </p> <p>Belgians communicate in a relaxed and open way. They will not be adverse to exchanging some pleasantries when you first meet as a means of breaking the ice and getting to know something about you. The French-speaking Walloons may be more conscious of rank. You should be very well aware of the differences between the Flemings and the Walloons and ensure that you know who you are dealing with. </p>"

Mid-morning or mid-afternoon are the best times for meetings in the country. Belgians are well-organised and will appreciate receiving an agenda and knowing in advance what topics are to be discussed, and the desired goal of a meeting. Agendas and any other necessary material should be distributed to everyone who will attend. If there is any doubt about the language to be spoken in a meeting, arrangements should be made for an interpreter to be present. If so, longer should be allowed for the meeting and translations of any necessary material should also be arranged. </p> <p><b>During the meeting</b></p> <p>Belgians are punctual and polite, so if you are to be delayed for long or for any reason, do ring ahead to let others know. Business cards are exchanged at meetings, especially when they have not been given <img height=\"200\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"$serverUrl$EUR.Belg.7;0.jpg\" width=\"133\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">out before any previous meeting. Belgians are quite open to exchanging some pleasantries and engaging in some social chat as they like to get to know people although they will not want to delay matters for too long. </p> <p>Belgians are rational thinkers and like to work through matters in a gradual way but the two language groups have a different style in meetings. At a Flemish meeting, you will be dealing with a group and everybody will have input. At a Walloon meeting, the group will look to its leader to speak and negotiate. The Latin influence in the Walloons may be felt in that personal feelings may be taken into consideration, too. Flemish managers are more inclined to allow subordinates to participate. </p> <p>Sales pitches should be well focused with good material to back up any claims or arguments, always using the appropriate language for the audience. Avoid any undue interruptions - conversations on mobile phones to others, for instance, may be seen as bad manners. </p> <p><b>After the meeting</b></p> <p>Spend some time at the end of a meeting rounding up on what has been discussed and what is the agreed way forward. Do not rush off but ensure that you offer polite goodbyes. Confirm matters which have been agreed in writing and follow through on matters which are to be attended to after a meeting. If decisions are to be made by your Belgian colleagues after a meeting, allow some time for this to happen as more senior managers in the Belgian associate may have to be consulted. If more information is requested, Belgians will expect a prompt reply. </p>"

Positive comments about the location and the country will be well received. Hard sells will not be appreciated and no - one in the audience should be put on the spot.
