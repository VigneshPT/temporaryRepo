Following nearly 16 years of military rule, a new constitution was adopted in 1999, and a peaceful transition to civilian government was completed. However, governing a country with some 250 ethnic groups and up to 400 languages, and where people's identity is with their tribe and village and not the concept of a nation created by the colonial British, is difficult. </p> <p>Through their turbulent past, Nigerians have tended to hold on to the familiar regional loyalties, ethnicity, kin and patron-client relations that protected them in an unstable and insecure environment. The structure of society today is a result of a combination of these geographical, ethnic and historic influences and socio-economic factors which bind the many ethnic groups together. The extended family is highly valued across all groups.</p> <p>Nigeria has a reputation for corruption, military regimes and violence, as well as longstanding ethnic and religious tensions. Crime is commonplace. Ethnic disputes flare up regularly and about 70% of people live under the poverty line, despite oil wealth. All parts of the country suffer from malarial outbreaks, and the overcrowded cities experience health and infrastructure problems.</p> <p>Having said this, Nigeria is also home to a diverse array of African languages, arts and cultures and has given birth to some of the continent's greatest writers and musicians. Despite their living conditions, Nigerians are dignified and proud. There is a strong sense of national honour and self-worth and they take offence to condescending attitudes by visitors.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Nigeria has one of the world's most diverse societies. Estimates of the number of distinct ethnic groupings vary from 250 to as many as 400, with as many as 400 different languages and dialects spoken. Nigerians cannot agree among themselves about which ethnic groups are actually closely related, and those that are not. People who live just a few kilometres apart often cannot understand one another. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Nige.1;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Broadly speaking, there are four dominant ethnic groups: the Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo or Ibo and Fulani. The south of the country includes a western, Yoruba-speaking area, an eastern Igbo area, a midsection of related but different groups, and a set of Niger Delta peoples on the eastern and central coastal areas. The north is mainly Islamic, with Sharia law (Islamic law) practiced in 12 states and education based on the Quran. </p> <p>The north is widely associated with the Muslim, Hausa-speaking groups while the Kanuri, a fifth group, predominate in the northeast with a belt of peoples between the two. There are also important pastoral nomadic groups (mostly Fulani) that live in the same region. </p> <p>Nigerians are likely to marry within their ethnic group or, at least within identical regions and language groups. It is extremely unlikely that a Christian would marry a Muslim. In cities, members of the same ethnic group will form communities and even within a company, people tend to be drawn to others from the same ethnic group.</p> <p>Nigeria's economy is neatly divided into oil earnings and agricultural earnings. Up to 70% of the population live in relative poverty, either farming, working on farms or selling cash crops. Larger commercial farms are constantly being developed as absentee landlords buy up pockets of land.</p> <p>Standards of living are improving in rural areas with transport, fresh water and education now available to many. The government has invested in some rural areas, creating schools, banks, roads, water and electricity supplies. Both urban and rural dwellers, however, live with a high occurrence of tropical and poverty-related diseases, with over 5% of the population infected with the HIV virus or AIDS. Life expectancy is young, at 47. In Lagos - the capital - there are stark contrasts between the hugely wealthy Nigerians and the impoverished, the poorest of whom live on the streets, beg and forage for a living. Ex-pats live in secure compounds with luxury amenities such as swimming pools and tennis courts. Great variations in lifestyle within geographical area and ethnicity exist. </p> <p>Lagos is Nigeria's business capital but the much smaller city of Abuja is the seat of government, and the site of important decision-making. Although millions of people live in cities, there is a great deal of domestic travel in Nigeria as so many people travel 'home' regularly to their villages. </p>"

      "body": " <p>Many Nigerians are relatively poor and their lives centre around family, their village and their tribe. The extended family is important among all tribes.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Nige.2;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Ethnic and national pride figure largely in conversations (although politics is not a safe topic for discussion). Discussions of Nigeria's contributions to the OAU (Organisation of African Unity) and ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) are welcomed.</p> <p>Among middle class Nigerians who have the means to enjoy leisure interests, American films are well known and talked about. Sports, including football (watching and playing), wrestling, polo, cricket and swimming are popular. </p> <p>Music is important to all Nigerians and the country has produced many fine musicians whose influence is believed to have shaped much contemporary music today. The country also has a strong literary tradition. Nigeria has a robust and free media and a number of people from different socio-economic groups, listen enthusiastically to the radio. Only the middle class have televisions, mobile phones and internet access.</p> <p>Among the middle classes, status symbols are important, particularly a smart car, good clothes and jewellery. </p> <p>Socialising tends to be done in the home, or in small, local cafes and restaurants. </p> <p>Religion is enormously important to Nigerians and it is quite common for people to sing hymns or pray in public. Preachers wait in motor parks (the large gathering places for taxis and other forms of transport) and bless each vehicle before it leaves. Company names often have religious connotations.</p>"

Don't try to rush things, be patient. Things get done through connections and personal trust. </li><li>Always accept hospitality; Nigerians are generous and outgoing and will be offended if you decline. </li><li>Be aware that casual attire is often considered to be a sign of a casual attitude. Wear conservative, but lightweight, clothes. </li><li>Show great respect. Address people with their titles and honorifics. It is considered offensive in Nigeria to pass an elderly person without greeting them. </li><li>Be very patient. Things take time for many reasons, e.g., decisions - even small ones - being made at the highest level. </li><li>Do business face-to-face whenever possible. First, it shows that you are serious and second, the communications infrastructure is not reliable, and faxes and emails are easily lost. </li><li>If having lunch with a Nigerian business acquaintance, make sure you use your right hand (or both hands) to pass and accept dishes. The left hand is taboo, and is rarely used for any interpersonal transactions. </li><li>Be sure to check out if there are objections to smoking or drinking in your location. </li><li>Hire a good driver. Taxis in Lagos tend to be unreliable and can be unsafe. </li><li>Expect to be asked for dash (a tip) at roadblocks, in the airport, and in other situations where people help you. Respect local laws, your nation's laws, and your company's code of conduct. </li></ol> </p><p></p>"

      "body": " <p>It is important to understand the strength of tribal bonds when working with Nigerians.. Nigerians first belong to a tribe, then a village and a faith and last of all to the country of Nigeria. As there are upwards of 250 tribes and languages, it is impossible to see Nigeria as a homogenous whole, despite government efforts to create this. There are cultural differences between each tribe (see Teamwork) but Nigerians do also have common traits: hospitality; friendliness; a respect for seniority; and a deep-rooted faith. Business relationships are based on trust, friendship, nepotism and the potential for mutual benefit.</p> <p>It is essential for expatriate workers to move into African time. Whatever your goals or corporate culture, there is no way to change the system in Nigeria, which moves slowly. Decisions are made slowly and by consensus, meetings take a long time and relationship-building takes a long time. Trying to impose a foreign culture on Nigeria will only lead to frustration. </p> <p>Traditional Nigerian companies have a strong vertical hierarchy and a dominant, often paternalistic leader. Information-sharing is restricted to those who need to know. Multinationals generally have flatter structures and are attractive employers to young, ambitious Nigerians.</p>"

      "body": " <p>In the workplace, recognise people by their names and enquire about their family and health. Make a point of doing this every day before you ask them to do anything for you. Nigerians are extremely polite and initially quite formal.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Nige.5;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Always dress smartly. Nigerians are very well dressed, regardless of the heat.. This applies to women too, taking into account Muslim sensibilities in the north of the country.</p> <p>Seniority matters in Nigeria, regardless of ethnic group. Treat anyone older than you, whether a gate guard or bank manager with civility and respect. Don't openly challenge older Nigerian colleagues, suppliers or customers even if you are higher up the corporate ladder. Find polite ways of allowing them to save face.</p> <p>Avoid words which could imply backwardness - native, jungle, witchcraft, huts, costumes, black magic etc. Always show respect for local traditions and customs and pay attention to family and tribal as well as national loyalties. The former are much stronger. In addition, learn to accept the often very public outbursts of religious fervour - praying or bursting into a hymn, for example.</p> <p>Learn the Nigerian way of communicating, using colourful idioms, stories, anecdotes and if you are delivering bad news use parables. Understand the concept of 'face' and do not cause anybody else to lose face. </p>"

      "body": " <p><b>Business cards</b></p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Nige.6;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Take a large supply of business cards to Nigeria and present them to everybody in the room at a meeting, including the secretary who is taking notes. Nigerians sometimes refer to business cards as 'compliments cards'. </p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>Nigerians will stand very close while talking and are often more tactile than Europeans or Americans feel comfortable with, e.g., grabbing someone's arm to make a point, or shaking hands for a very long time while talking. Try to get used to this and don't shrink away. Nigerians are expressive, emotional and place great value on friendship - so your body language should reflect this. Presentations and arguments should be enthusiastic and articulate. An audience will read your facial expressions, try to be as animated as you can.</p> <p>Do not use your left hand, even if you're dealing with non-Muslims. Do not touch other people with it, or eat with it. </p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>Communication style is implicit and often indirect, although Nigerians will not hesitate to make a point in an argument. There is however, a strong concept of 'face' which means that a Nigerian may find it difficult to say 'no' directly as it could cause someone to lose face. Problems in the workplace may not be confronted openly and it may be left up to you, as a manager, to discover them for yourself.</p> <p><b>Gift-giving</b></p> <p>Gift-giving is ingrained in the Nigerian culture. Your business contact may appreciate a small gift reflecting your country's culture. </p> <p>Do not confuse gifts with 'dash', the Nigerian term for small and frequent cash bribes. You may require 'dash' simply to get out of the airport. Although the government is clamping down hard on corruption, you are unlikely to get through a trip to Nigeria without having to part with a few N20 bills to officials or at road blocks. If you appear confident and look as though you know where you are going, you are less likely to be hit up for 'dash'.</p>"

      "body": " <p><b>Planning a meeting</b></p> <p>Plan on conducting business face-to-face. The telephone and mail systems are not always reliable so begin making meeting arrangements well in advance. If you are already in the country, make <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Nige.7;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">appointments in person. Some offices will see you at once.. In the same manner, you should be prepared to spend time with someone who turns up unannounced to visit you.</p> <p>Important documentation should be carried or sent ahead by a reputable courier service. Nigerians are not known for their timeliness but you should be prompt nonetheless. </p> <p>Arrange for refreshments and have a ready supply of business cards in English. Expect seating to be hierarchical. Dress smartly for a meeting - Nigerian counterparts will and doing the same is a sign of respect.</p> <p>In order for prompt decisions to be made, make sure that you will be meeting senior executives. Lower and middle management are not usually empowered to sign off on a deal even if they suggest to you that they are.</p> <p><b>During a meeting</b></p> <p>Expect to begin the meeting with a period of greetings and personal conversation. Hurrying to get past such conversation would be insulting to your hosts. Try to listen rather than to talk and be respectful, particularly with elders. Do not interrupt even when someone is speaking and you are agreeing with them.. Do not bring up the subject of corruption; Nigerians are very sensitive about this.</p> <p>A first meeting is to establish your credentials and trustworthiness and to create opportunities for reciprocity. </p> <p>You can come to a meeting with an agenda but it is more likely that the most important topics will be discussed first rather than sticking to the order on the agenda. Important items will not be left until a satisfactory outcome has been achieved. Decisions are made by consensus and be aware that nobody should lose face. Be prepared for lively bargaining but avoid exaggerations or promises you may have to revise. </p> <p><b>After the meeting</b></p> <p>Once the all important personal rapport is achieved subsequent meetings should be less formal. Follow up all meetings in writing, on your company letterhead and do not rely on email to distribute minutes.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Nigerians who are building businesses tend to be self-motivated, willing to work long and hard. There are a growing number of entrepreneurs who are working to build Nigeria's new middle class. Many <img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Nige.8;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">employees, on the other hand, will work to avoid work. This attitude derives from having little faith in the system, i.e., they don't believe job performance leads to job advancement. Rather nepotism and favouritism are the usual means of getting ahead. The system of seniority also plays its part in reinforcing this attitude. </p> <p>Work for its own sake is not a priority and a Nigerian team will most likely be motivated by an employer who understands and accommodates family commitments and tribal kinship - a leader who is paternalistic and caring taking the trouble to learn people's names and enquire after them and who is fair and shows kindness and integrity.</p> <p>Achieving status is prized - for example, prestigious titles and offices. Lower down the scale, employees may be motivated simply by comfort - a housing allowance, or subsidized meals. One month's pay is normally given as a Christmas bonus or at the end of Ramadan for Muslim staff. In addition to this, some employers choose to give gifts of food or clothing while others also give an additional month's holiday pay. </p>"

      "title": "Effective Presentations",
      "body": " <p>A Nigerian's communication style is warm, friendly and colourful and any presentation should reflect this. Use proverbs and stories where appropriate and if you have a negative point to get across, try to do it indirectly by using parables. Engage the audience and make frequent eye contact. Any humour should be gentle, possibly veering into light slapstick. Be very careful to avoid offending ethnic sensibilities. If a Nigerian is making a presentation, it may be long and flowery in addition to being full of rhetoric. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Nige.9;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Do not rely heavily on technology for a presentation. There is a good chance that a power outage will occur in the middle of it. In such an event it is better to be prepared and make index cards, or memorise the presentation content.. Do not make rude remarks about the Nigerian power supply if this happens. Simply keep talking and be prepared to illustrate your point with words rather than slides. If the presentation is technical and complicated, have material ready to hand out. Any backup material should be in English, as should your company information.</p> <p>A Nigerian audience will normally listen attentively. The concept of time is different in Nigeria, and there is no need to rush through a presentation. In fact, delivering something too quickly will make the audience wonder why you are in such a hurry. Questions after the presentation may take you in a circular pattern; allow plenty of time for discussion. Complete silence may indicate disagreement with your point or the simply that the audience has not understood.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Nigerians, like Asians, have a strong sense of 'face' and in any relationship this needs to be preserved. Feedback should be delivered carefully, particularly if it is negative, and individuals should not be singled out for attention. Problems may not be confronted openly because of the fear of recrimination. Teams have to be carefully managed. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"$serverUrl$AFR.Nige.10;0.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Nigerians can be entrepreneurial and self-motivated or operate at the other end of the spectrum, weighed down with apathy and avoiding responsibility. Many feel that there is little point in trying harder and that nepotism and favouritism are more likely routes to success than hard work and achievement. Strong, sympathetic and caring leadership is important. Formal coaching is rare but mentoring works well.</p> <p>Nigerian culture has a strong respect for seniority, which is associated with wisdom, and older people should always be treated with deference, whatever their position. It is important to remember this when appointing team leaders or choosing a negotiating team; older Nigerian workers may not respond well to a young, aggressive leader. Sending a young negotiating team may be taken as a sign that you are not serious about a deal.</p>"
