Children tend to stay at home until they marry and family ties are very strong.</p> <p>Mexicans tend to have a 'work to live' attitude but nonetheless work long hours - many put in a six-day week.</p> <p>Characteristics of Mexicans in general include selflessness, generosity, hospitality and fatalism.</p> <p>Mexicans can carry their own preconceived ideas about 'gringos' or Europeans, and may see their own society as considerably more civilised than those of the USA and Europe.</p>"

Despite the vast open spaces of the Mexican countryside, people are more comfortable in a crowded city, for economic and social reasons.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227096/pid-2080167-227096-704251043.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Eight out of ten Mexicans have Spanish blood and Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world. There are, however, a further 62 indigenous languages, spoken by 6m people. Over a million of these only speak their indigenous language. Only the educated elite or people working in tourism speak English. </p> <p>More than 50% of population lives below the poverty line, with some 20% living in extreme poverty. The gulf between rich and poor, and between rich tourist and poor local, is enormous. Living standards are higher in the North, near the US border, than in the poorer, rural South. </p> <p>Mexican society is strongly family-orientated. Children stay at home until they marry, and the young care for the old. Every Mexican child has the right to free primary education, although many leave school early to help support their families. Families will always eat together, often taking the main meal at lunchtime. </p> <p>Status is achieved by a mixture of hard work and proving oneself, and sometimes by nepotism. So while a man may make it to the top because of his connections, he has to justify himself along the way, building a strong network.</p>"

An evening promenade before sitting down to eat is common, particularly in rural and coastal areas. Long discussions and impassioned debates over dinner are common. </p> <p>Mexico is predominantly a Catholic country and a lot of people attend church and observe religious holidays, although many of these have a distinct and very colourful Mexican twist to them.</p> <p>Soccer is a national obsession, as a spectator and participation sport. Basketball is also popular. Music and dancing play a big role in the country's social life, as do the many fiestas on the social calendar.</p> <p>Mexico has a spectacular heritage of art, craft and architecture, and many people work hard to keep the old traditions alive, making a living from the arts at the same time. The younger generation, however, is more interested in computer games and shopping.</p> <p>Mexico has a huge coastline to the east and west, and beach life is important to anyone living within reach of the coast.</p>"

Wait to be invited to address someone by his/her first name. Use formal titles to recognise someone's status. </li><li>Make business appointments in advance. Confirm them a few days before, and on arrival in Mexico. It is customary for a number of secretaries to process call. Try to find direct lines. Mobile numbers when possible. </li><li>Be aware that calls or messages left will be answered.. In most cases, Mexicans tend to think that if a call is important it will be placed again. Voice-mail systems are considered unfriendly. </li><li>Recognise that Mexico is a hierarchical society, and expect business deals to be made at the highest levels. </li><li>Expect a more relaxed attitude to time (time is not money; money is for enjoying life). Given their exposure to other countries, you may find an accommodation to your orientations toward time is made. </li><li>Try not to cause a Mexican to lose face. </li><li>Accept and extend invitations. Socialising is important and an accepted way of getting to know your Mexican counterpart. </li><li>Recognise that there is often a considerable gap between the executive level and the execution levels in Mexico business. The Mexican executive may agree with you, but must seriously consider how the rest of the company will execute agreements. </li><li>Expect meetings to stray from the agenda and run over time.

There is a strong sense of personal and national honour; Mexicans come from a great culture and are proud of it.

Family ties are very important, and a good business networker will win the trust of Mexican counterparts to become part of the extended family. In order to get through the door in the first place, though, it is important to have a local intermediary make the introduction.</p> <p>Smart dress, a basic command of Spanish, a warm and outgoing personality and a strong sense of diplomacy will all contribute towards a successful relationship with Mexicans.</p>"

Don't criticise the country's politics, or draw attention to its poverty. Be a good listener but expect to be interrupted yourself. Always ask after somebody's family and show respect and deference to older people.</p> <p>Accept all social invitations and return the favour. Business entertaining is an essential part of commerce and you will be judged on whether you join in, and how entertaining you are as a guest. Being charismatic, or known to be able to tell a good story is always a benefit.</p> <p>Remember that saving face is important in Mexico. Do not say or do anything that will cause somebody to lose face. If you need to criticise, don't do it in front of colleagues. Being sarcastic will not work, nor will humiliating a Mexican.</p>"

Business cards printed on one side in Spanish will be appreciated but are not essential. Your card should include your degree and any title (Doctor, Professor etc). </p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227096/pid-2080161-227096-704251043.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Mexicans are more tactile than most north Europeans and north Americans. Increased physical contact is often a sign of progress in the negotiations. Don't back away - this could be regarded as an insult.</p> <p>The abrazo is a combined bear hug and hearty slap on the back, used by male friends and close colleagues on arrival and departure. Women friends greet and part with a slight embrace and a kiss on each cheek. Avoid too much direct eye contact, which can appear challenging, but do maintain a steady gaze.</p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>Gesturing and high level of emotion are common in all Latin American cultures.</p> <p>The Spanish language, with its wealth of diminutive endings, its rich vocabulary and multiple-choice options on most nouns, is extremely suitable for expressing emotion, endearments and nuances. The language exudes warmth, excitement and, at times, exaggeration. The Castilian word hablar - to speak- comes from fabulare, meaning 'to invent' in Latin, reflecting the Spanish enjoyment for creation and performance in communication.</p> <p>Intuition is as important as fact in Mexican business culture. Consequently, it's important that you work at developing an excellent rapport with your Mexican counterparts. If they have a favourable impression of you, and believe that you can be trusted, the likelihood of your success increases.</p> <p>Impressions count. Dress well and stay in the best hotels to win the respect of your Mexican counterparts before negotiations begin.</p> <p><b>Gift giving</b></p> <p>Gifts are not required as part of the negotiating process but may be appreciated as a gesture of friendship. Don't spend too much or ask what someone would like as a gift - this is considered to be offensive.</p> <p>Only tasteful items bearing a company logo should be given, such as quality pens or desk accessories. Local crafts from to your home region are often appreciated as gifts, but avoid silver. Mexicans are proud of their silver, which they believe to be the finest in the world.</p> <p>If invited to a private home, there is no need to take a large gift. If you wish to reciprocate invite your host and hostess out for a return meal. Otherwise, a small, token item, such as chocolates or something for the children, will always be appreciated. If taking flowers, check their suitability with a Mexican florist - yellow flowers symbolise death and red ones the casting of spells.</p>"

These individuals can be found via Mexican trade missions. A prior appointment is essential. Phone to confirm the appointment once you are in Mexico and make sure you leave contact details with your counterpart's secretary.</p> <p>Expect your first meeting to be the first of many. Negotiations in Latin and Central America are a long, drawn-out process. Turn up on time but expect to wait - keeping you waiting enhances the importance of the person you are meeting.</p> <p>Business in Mexico is all about personal relationships. Backup materials and brochures, however impressive, are generally far less important than the impression you make on the day.</p> <p><b>During the meeting</b></p> <p>Do not expect to discuss business at the start of any meeting. During a first meeting, Mexicans will want to become acquainted with you before proceeding with business, so be accommodating and answer any questions about your background and perhaps family life.</p> <p>A first meeting is designed to establish trust and respect at the highest levels. Subsequent meetings may well be carried out by subordinates, although you should continue to send your highest-ranking executives.</p> <p>Lively discussion, which, if you don't speak Spanish, may sound like heated argument, will take place in meetings. It is not a sign of aggression. Allow your counterpart to control the agenda and pace of the meeting.</p> <p><b>After the meeting</b></p> <p>The meeting will frequently continue over lunch or into the evening, as a way of assessing you, your trustworthiness and whether you are a suitable person with whom to do business.</p> <p>Expect heavy bureaucracy when dealing with government bodies, but an element of business being done on trust in the private sector. Deals are almost always concluded in person, rather than over the phone or by letter, but you will need to get written confirmation.</p> <p>As a deal is signed, be sure to have copies of all relevant files and legal documents at hand, as well as your own identification.</p>"

They work to live, but do not live to work. Family, friendships and social occasions are more important than putting in extra hours at the office to impress the boss. Having said this, Mexicans today, particularly the younger generation, have a strong work ethic and a keen sense of ambition.
