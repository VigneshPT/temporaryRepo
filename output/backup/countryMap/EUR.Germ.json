Germany has a distinctly hierarchical society, with classes established to fill organisational roles and give structure and order. Equal rights for all are guaranteed by law but may not be practiced in the marketplace. Women still have a strong bias to overcome in both pay and power.</p> <p>German society draws much from both belief systems in the form of the Ten Commandments of which the most important are 'Liebe Deinen N&auml;chsten wie Dich selbst' ('Love thy neighbour as thyself'), 'Du sollst nicht l&uuml;gen' (honesty) and 'Du sollst nicht t&ouml;ten' (anchored in human rights, law and order).</p>"

      "body": " <p>Humour is often said to be out of place in German business. Business is taken seriously and meetings tend to be formal, but this does not mean that people are humourless. A humorous remark that is relevant to the situation is more likely to break down barriers than to create them. Germans are often perceived as distant and hard to get to know. As they place a high value on their private sphere and draw a clear line between business and pleasure, it simply takes longer to get behind the barrier of the real person.</p> <p><b>Business cards</b></p> <p><img height=\"133\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227086/pid-2080164-227086-704231047.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Prepare to exchange plenty of business cards, especially at first meetings or with people you don't know yet. Do not expect business cards to be treated with too much respect; they just serve to capture the name, function and academic qualification of your counterpart as well as the details for correspondence.</p> <p>Business cards in general will include the professional title and rank of the cardholder. It is recommended to use the professional title (Doktor, for example) until your counterpart asks you to stick to their family name only. Since education is highly respected in Germany, it is appropriate to include any title above bachelor degree level on your card. If your company has been around for many years, the date of its founding should be on your business card, too.</p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>In business the brief and firm handshake is common. Direct eye contact is often interpreted as a sign of being trustworthy in what you say and mean. Maintaining eye contact shows attention and strengthens your message to your German counterpart. Avoid touching and keep gestures restrained.</p> <p>While Germans are open and generous with close friends, they tend to be formal and reserved in public. You will not see many smiles or displays of affection on German streets or in the course of business. Germans smile to indicate affection, rather than at customers or at co-workers.</p> <p>The avoidance of public spectacle is reflected in the way Germans will get quite close to each other before offering a greeting. Only the younger generation waves and or shouts at each other from a distance.</p> <p>Recognition of personal space is a matter of etiquette and status. In offices, doors are often kept closed to express a preference for working undisturbed. It is expected to knock before entering. Executives generally prefer visitors to enter via the secretary's office. The importance of a person in the hierarchy can often be recognised by the size, position and quality of furniture of the office.</p> <p>To signal 'good luck', Germans make two fists with thumbs tucked inside other fingers and then make a motion as if they are pounding lightly on a surface. To signal the number 'one' or say that something is great, hold the thumb upright.</p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>The German communication style is very direct, short and in general very quickly to the point, to the point where it can seem abrupt, although this is not intended. Germans can be more frank than Americans or British people are used to. They can be perceived as insensitive and pushy. Feelings and the emotional aspects of business are downplayed. Reliability and the integrity of the business are high priorities. The features and performance of a product are more important than its looks and packaging.</p> <p>Organisation and the appearance of organisation are also high priorities. Concise statements appear simple-minded, although overstatement is also disliked, so you need to strike a balance. New information is not readily accepted, but Germans are very persevering and persistent when assessing new situations and information. They do, however, abhor hype and exaggeration. Be sure you can back up your claims with lots of data. Case studies and examples are highly regarded.</p> <p>Small talk is not traditional. Germans tend to like people who are very clear about their expectations and getting down to business is the norm. In explanations, however, they often find it necessary to lay a proper foundation and provide a historical context.</p> <p><b>Gift giving</b></p> <p><img height=\"160\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227086/pid-2080161-227086-704231047.jpg\" width=\"173\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">It is not necessary to give expensive gifts. Provided they are of good quality, items such as pens, pocket calculators or imported liquor will be more than adequate. If you present wine or beer, it will be more appreciated if they are types not so readily available in Germany. Gifts made in your home country would be good, perhaps with your company logo. When it comes to clothing, a sport shirt with your company logo might be appreciated, but in general clothing is not considered appropriate as a gift. The same goes for perfumes or soaps, on the grounds that they are too personal.</p>"

Calling each other by first names will take time.</p> <p>After a quick review of the agenda, the business of the meeting will begin. Meetings are usually dominated by the senior person and are formal and structured. Meetings only between peers tend to be more open to discussion and debate.</p> <p>Communication will tend to be direct, unemotional and comprehensive. Direct communication is perceived as respectful rather than rude.</p> <p>Thinking tends to be very analytical and conceptual which can appear to a foreigner as very detailed and complex. There is a high distrust of simple utterances.</p> <p>Proposals and ideas will have been thought through in some detail in advance and might sound like statements of fact rather than proposals.</p> <p>Participants may not be open to other points of view unless they are also well supported by evidence.</p> <p>Listeners look for logic and consistence in thinking and talking. They will discover very quickly whether a speaker is qualified to speak about a topic or not.</p> <p>Technical expertise is valued and respected and often deferred to. Participants who are not well-informed will usually keep quiet. As business is seen as a serious endeavour, participants in general will pay close attention and often ask detailed questions.</p> <p>Conflicts that could have been prevented&nbsp;- but are not - are considered wasteful and inefficient and are very much discouraged. Ideally, differences will be resolved in advance or dealt with later.</p> <p><b>Following a meeting</b></p> <p>Minutes will be taken and distributed. Action plans should be clear, specific and in writing. Schedules and plans will be followed rigorously.</p> <p>If circumstances change, the action plans or contracts should be renegotiated, and not just changed in an informal way.</p>"
