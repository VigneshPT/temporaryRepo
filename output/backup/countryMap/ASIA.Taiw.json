The Taiwanese have a reputation for being quirky, fun-loving, individualist and informal, while continuing to embrace the Confucian values of the mainland. They are enterprising and creative, particularly when it comes to circumventing what are seen as unnecessary and bureaucratic laws.</p> <p>The Taiwanese have demonstrated their resilience through the great upheavals which have been endured throughout their history. They are motivated by a need for social harmony. They also place much emphasis on self-control and expect to find it in others. The Taiwanese are very much given to praising others and flattering them. </p> <p>The family is of paramount importance in Taiwan and the loyalty of family and friends is often called on and is essential in getting things done. Authority and seniority are much respected. The Taiwanese have a strong work ethic and despite being very traditional, society is progressive at the same time. Most strive for a good education and good standards of living. </p>"

      "body": " <p>In the eyes of the Chinese government, and much of the world, Taiwan is a province of China (PRC). The PRC claims sovereignty over Taiwan. While Beijing claims to be the legitimate government of all China including Taiwan, Taipei's position is that China is temporarily divided between two territories administered by two separate governments. To Beijing, Taiwan is a 'renegade' province that needs to come to terms with the central government. For its part, Taiwan sees itself as a separate and equal entity, calling itself the \"Republic of China, on Taiwan\".</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227333/pid-2080167-227333-704261523.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">More than 150 countries do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan and any relations are unofficial. However, lack of diplomatic relations has not prevented the development of a number of broad-based and healthy relationships, especially in economic areas, with countries like Australia and Britain. Taiwan currently has diplomatic relations with only 26 countries.</p> <p>Taiwan is a heavily populated island but has a very low birth rate, which is a cause for concern for the government. Many people live in crowded domestic conditions and property prices are high in the cities. The Taiwanese are frugal and hard working and education is highly valued. Many aspire to higher education and technical qualifications and good jobs. </p> <p>Family ties are much valued but many younger people are postponing marriage and parenthood until they become financially independent and settled in their careers. People are also motivated to work hard as the social security system is not as advanced as it is in other developed countries. </p> <p>Pollution and public health problems like a supply of reliably clean water have resulted from the rapid economic development and the growth of cities. Real energy is, however, being put into improving the quality of life on the island and on social reform and progression. </p> <p>The large majority of Taiwan's population, some 98%, is of Chinese origin with the remaining 2% being made up of various groups of indigenous people. Most of the population lives in densely populated urban areas. </p> <p>There is no official faith and various religions are practiced. Religion is of real importance in the spiritual life of the people. The religions and philosophical traditions followed are Taosim, Confucianism and Buddhism but folk customs and beliefs are also important. </p>"

The Taiwanese are very industrious and frugal though they will save up for items of high value.

Taiwan offers active recreational opportunities for the more ambitious, like mountain climbing, hiking, fishing, camping and other activities. In the warm summer months there's dragon boat racing as well as other water sports and activities such as whale and dolphin watching, snorkelling, white water rafting, wind surfing and surfing, while airborne sports such as hang gliding and paragliding are also enjoyed. Golf is a preferred sporting pastime of Taiwanese businessmen.</p> <p>Basketball is one of the most popular team sports, played indoors away from the changeable weather. Martial arts are widely practiced. The arts are also popular, a mix of traditional Chinese arts and crafts like painting, calligraphy, ceramics, dance and music, and local arts as Taiwan forges its own cultural identity.</p> <p>In the cities, society centres around shopping in the many lavish malls, and eating out. Taipei is peppered with good restaurants, from cafes and tea houses to gourmet international establishments. Dining out and entertaining are important aspects of city life.</p> <p>Taiwan produces some fine films though they are often more successful overseas. Local film-makers often have to go abroad to work. Perhaps Taiwan's most famous export in the film world is Ang Lee, director of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Eat Drink Man Woman, Sense and Sensibility and Brokeback Mountain.</p> <p>Religious beliefs are important to the Taiwanese but they will often take what appeals to them from various religions. Family and friends lie at the core of people's lives and great loyalty is shown to them. </p>"

      "body": " <p>There are several basic notions held by the Taiwanese which are part of the Chinese approach and philosophy. One is guanxi - or the close ties of family and friends and the loyalties that go with them. These are most important in business and should be respected. When building relationships, take note of the idea that friendship is to be valued. Another is the concept of `face', which applies all over the Asian and Arab worlds. Displays of impatience or temper will be greatly frowned upon and will involve a loss of face for anyone on the receiving end and also, in their view, a loss of face for the person who has lost control. </p> <p>Several values shared with those on mainland China include modesty and tolerance, courtesy, patience, moderation and harmony. Many of the ideas which prevail today are derived from the teaching of Confucius. Respectful, orderly behaviour will be expected and will also win confidence. Having said this, the Taiwanese appear to be more spirited than mainland Chinese, thanks to their history of rebellion, and are entrepreneurial and ambitious. They can be suspicious of foreigners but at the same time, value their input.</p>"

Loyalty and harmony count for much. <img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227333/pid-2080179-227333-704261523.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Time and energy must be spent in building relationships and trust. Politeness and restraint in personal relationships is key as is saving face and not causing embarrassment or discomfort and showing respect for seniors. High pressure sales tactics should be avoided, and you should never press someone for a direct answer (especially if it's likely to be 'no'), but rather, learn to read between the lines. Avoid delicate subjects like the political situation with China unless you feel sure that a discussion would be welcomed. </p> <p>Business entertaining should be taken seriously and the correct protocol followed. Learn to use chopsticks and learn the rules of table etiquette. </p> <p>Respect should be shown by being smartly dressed, punctual and well prepared for business meetings. Be reliable and follow up on matters that need your further attention. </p> <p>Visitors to Taiwan should understand the Taiwanese ritual of paying compliments. If someone compliments you, you should insist that you are not worthy; modesty is an important attribute here.</p>"

A card is absolutely critical to the Taiwanese, so they can place you in context.</p> <p>Cards should be presented with both hands. Doing so indicates that you are presenting the fullest extent of yourself. When receiving a business card, bow slightly in acknowledgment and put it into a smart business card case to read later. Do not put it in a back pocket - which may suggest that you may wish to sit on that person! Include not only your name but your job title on your cards so the Taiwanese can assess your rank. A list of qualifications may, however, be seen as a display of vanity and modesty is greatly valued in this society. Include a translation in Mandarin on the reverse side of the card, ideally in raised gold text. Beware of red ink which has negative connotations.</p> <p><strong>Body Language</strong></p> <p>Taiwanese communication style is high-context and studying body language is an important way of understanding what your counterpart is really saying. Physical movements in Chinese society are subtle rather than flamboyant. Show respect by exercising physical restraint. Staring into someone's eyes for too long is considered disrespectful, as is touching them while talking. Physical contact is usually reserved for friends and family. Many live in crowded conditions and they value their personal space and privacy. Keep a good distance - say a metre - when you are in discussions with them. Maintain an upright bearing and do not point with one finger. Don't touch children on the head and do not point your feet at someone.</p> <p><strong>Communication Style</strong></p> <p>The Taiwanese are polite and respectful and will often pay people compliments. Their communication style is high-context and subtle. Any aggressive or boastful behaviour will not be well received and will create suspicion. Do not be afraid of silences - Westerners can often seem to talk too much. Nor should you try to hurry discussions. Remember that the concept of `face' is very important and must be maintained in both parties. </p> <p><strong>Gift Giving </strong></p> <p>The Taiwanese are usually good and generous hosts. Giving gifts is an important part of business life. Gifts may be quite lavish and you should reciprocate with something of similar value. Make a business visit armed with several gifts, so you won't be caught short. </p> <p>Something from your own country, or spirits, or for a home visit, chocolates are appropriate. Clocks should be avoided - in Mandarin the phrase `give a clock' sounds like attending a funeral. Giving a handkerchief can also imply that someone is going to cry soon. White, grey and black are associated with funerals, red is lucky - though red writing is associated with making a protest, pink and yellow represent happiness and prosperity. Sets of four also represent death. </p> <p>Gifts are usually not opened immediately - to do so implies greed. A gift should not be opened in front of the giver (to save face all round) and should be refused three times, as a sign of modesty.</p>"

People in private enterprises will be more readily available. Be well prepared with all the facts and figures you may be called on to supply; a thorough knowledge of your own company, product and competition is essential. </p> <p>Let your counterparts know what you want to achieve in the meeting. One-to-one meetings are more unusual than they are in the West. Find out who you will be meeting and the relative status of the people in the group, and offer the Taiwanese the same information about your own party in return. Establish whether you will need an interpreter (you almost certainly will) and if you do, schedule extra time for the meeting. </p> <p><strong>During the meeting</strong></p> <p>Meetings with Taiwanese will initially be about getting to know each other and will always start with small talk over refreshments. Expect the most senior person in the group to do the talking. Seating will be arranged according to hierarchy and the most senior person should sit facing the door. </p> <p>Maintain politeness at all times and never show aggression or irritation; embarrassing anyone which will cause them and you to lose face. Bragging or ostentatious behaviour will be frowned upon. Show great respect to the most senior person of the team. </p> <p>Be aware that rather than say `no', your counterparts may only remain silent or be evasive. </p> <p><strong>After the meeting </strong></p> <p>Decisions may be taken slowly and any pressure to sign a contract may not be well received. Follow up in writing what was said and agreed at the meeting. Be aware that you should set artificial deadlines if you are going to impose time limits for work, as the Taiwanese will regard deadlines as guidelines only. Expect negotiations to continue after a contract has been signed.</p> <p>Your counterparts are likely to invite you out for an evening. It is essential to accept; during the evening and while alcohol is being drunk, they will continue to assess you as someone they may want to do business with. You should return the invitation at a later date.</p>"

It is common for Taiwanese to imply that they are not worthy if somebody pays them a compliment, which Western managers should bear in mind.</p> <p>It has been suggested that because of the importance to the Taiwanese of a sense of belonging to a group, the welfare of the group is important to the individual, but this is too simplistic. Self-interest and reward, with the additional burden of saving face, are just as important. </p> <p>In middle management and larger companies, the trend for job mobility also indicates that Taiwanese, especially young Taiwanese are motivated to learn and improve their lot in life. As in the West, bonuses and other financial rewards are good motivators. Good recognition for a job well done is also much appreciated in this society where the approval of the group is important. </p>"

While you can outline the benefits of your products or services and the positive history and achievements of your organisation, do not be boastful. Emphasise your reliability and the fact that you can be trusted - and make sure that this is true! While friendliness can be shown, err on the side of a conservative, very respectful and businesslike approach. Be prepared for detailed questions at the end - or during the presentation. The Taiwanese may smoke during the presentation.</p> <p>Your audience will not expect you to be very physically demonstrative in your presentation. Hands are not used much here. Be restrained in your movements. Show extra respect for those who are older; any points you are emphasising should be made while making eye contact to the senior members of the audience. </p> <p>People may be reluctant to ask questions if they have not understood a point, as it will cause them to lose face.

Managing relationships in the workplace and with customers and suppliers means understanding the rules of guanxi and knowing when to call in favours (rinqing), a tally of which most Taiwanese seem to carry around in their heads. Diplomacy is required at all times, as are strong leadership skills. When managing a team, an understanding of just how important the workplace is to a Taiwanese person - essentially an extension of the family home - is essential.</p> <p>Education, particularly overseas, and hard work are seen as positives - the Taiwanese have a particularly strong work ethic.
