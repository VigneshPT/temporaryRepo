Scholars and creative artists enjoy a degree of respect seldom experienced by others in the West. Poles today are a highly educated people, thanks to the expansion of higher education and the democratization of educational opportunities over the past 45 years. They do not hesitate to speak out and tell foreign visitors what's on their minds, although in the workplace they may initially appear dour and uncommunicative.</p> <p>Poles are also polite and formal. The language has a polite form and certain rules of etiquette should be observed when meeting someone for the first time.</p> <p>Poles are good listeners and will give a friend their full attention, expecting the same in return. Friendships are rarely superficial.</p>"

The countryside is dotted with single factory towns, where the fate of the entire town depends on the success of the factory. Many of these towns suffer from high unemployment.</p> <p>The Polish population is young. Half of people are under 33 years old and one third are under 19. The <img height=\"151\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227102/pid-2080161-227102-704251356.jpg\" width=\"195\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">percentage of children and youths in the population is greater than in Germany or in the Czech Republic.</p> <p>Much focus lies on family life in Poland, with young people usually staying in the parental home until they marry (and sometimes after that). The church is core to everyday life; churches are the symbolic heart of even the smallest villages across the rural landscape, while large city cathedrals harbour enormous wealth. The former pope, a Pole from Krakow, was a symbol of huge national pride. Church attendance is, however, on the decline.</p> <p>Poland has a number of minority groups, the officially recognised ones being: Belorussians, Czechs, Lithuanians, Germans, Armenians, Russians, Slovaks, Ukrainians, Jews, Karaites, Lemkos, Roma and Tartars.</p> <p>The USA has a growing influence on society. Many Poles are involved with with American companies, more than 250 of which have now created offices, factories, subsidiaries or joint ventures in Poland. Poland is drawing billions of dollars in new investment every year as U.S. and other foreign firms seek to take advantage of Poland's large population and location in the heart of Europe. An added attraction is that the country is a new NATO and European Union member with a record of political stability and commitment to free market principles.</p>"

Teams need close leadership and supervision and managers often lack confidence, holding their foreign investors in awe.

      "body": " <p>Poland is a rather formal and polite society, so good manners and etiquette must be observed at all times. Dress smartly but conservatively, be prompt for meetings (even though your Polish counterpart <img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227102/pid-2080179-227102-704251357.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">may not be) and be warm but not overly gushing or effusive; Poles can&nbsp;appear&nbsp;fairly dour until you get to know them and will be overwhelmed by grandiose gestures and expressions.</p> <p>In business, the quickest way to make a good impression is to have a local contact to introduce you. This is often a necessity rather than a nicety. If you are selling something to Poles, they will be impressed and reassured if you have local representation and technical support.

      "title": "Business Etiquette",
      "body": " <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>Poles favour direct communication and may almost seem too direct in some cases, asking personal questions and catching their foreign counterparts unawares. Intentions, feelings and opinions are openly expressed.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227102/pid-2080164-227102-704251356.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">The Polish culture has always been open to information from the West. With the demise of Communism, many aspects of education in Poland are in a state of flux. Poles are abstractive, processing information conceptually and analytically. They value relationships as much as the law. Truth rests more on objective facts than on the subjective feelings of the moment. Faith in ideologies that may change one's perspective on the truth is changing, shifting from the ideologies of the Communist party to those of nationalism and democracy.</p> <p>The archaic third person form is used in addressing persons in the formal (impersonal) mode. Rather than ask, \"Do you want...\" Poles will say, \"Does the lord (or lady) wish...\" Even the simplest worker or peasant will use forms of speech and behaviour derived from the Szlachta (pronounced shlakh-tah), the landed nobility and gentry who ruled Poland until the end of the 18th century. Like the szlachta, today's Poles show an independent spirit and are ready to express their personal opinions on any subject raised. The szlachta embodied a belief in personal liberty, republicanism and individual rights.</p> <p>Despite their directness, Poles are often subtle in their communication style. Thoughts are often expressed in an indirect and roundabout way in the expectation that the real meaning will somehow be understood. Humour is often used to make a point, provided Poland is not the butt of that humour.</p> <p><b>Gift giving</b></p> <p>According to Polish business etiquette, gifts are given at the beginning of a relationship, particularly when contacts are made for the first time, and also at the end of an association. In the first case, you should handle gift-giving with care in order to avoid being misunderstood.</p> <p>If someone invites you for dinner or supper at a home, you should be aware that small gifts such as a bottle of wine or a bouquet of flowers for the hostess are expected. Do not forget to send a hand-written card to your host/hostess thanking them for their invitation and time.</p> <p>The best gifts are always items which are typical or representative of your culture. Someone from Switzerland, for example, could buy some carefully chosen chocolate. Another good gift would be a book describing your country or the region you are from.</p> <p>Do not give an extremely expensive gift - certainly no more than 200 Euros and always respect your company's policy when considering gift-giving.</p> <p><b>Business cards</b></p> <p>It is best to exchange business cards when you first meet a businessperson, and you should be the first to hand over your card. Have your business cards ready before each meeting. It is not necessary to have your business cards translated - English is acceptable. Carry a plentiful supply, though, as Poles like to exchange cards. If you read someone's title on a card and are not sure how to address them, the best way is Mr, Mrs or Ms followed by their title - director, editor, lawyer etc.</p>"

A company profile and product literature, translated into Polish, should be provided.</p> <p>Turn up on time for a meeting and if you are using technical equipment, make sure you know how to work it. Bring your own laptop and projector if in any doubt as to the quality of the Polish equipment. Poland has a well-established broadband service but it is still best to check in advance if you are depending on a fast connection for a presentation.</p> <p>When entering the meeting room, wait for your host to point you to the place where you are going to sit. If in the meeting room there are people you do not know, wait for a third person to carry out the introductions.</p> <p><b>During a meeting</b></p> <p>Every kind of meeting starts with some small talk. This socialising allows everybody to relax and also to make first judgments about the negotiating partners. It is your chance to make a good impression as an intelligent and straightforward speaker. Do not be surprised if your Polish counterparts appear unsmiling and unforthcoming. This is normal. They may seem taciturn but will challenge you if they feel they need to.</p> <p><b>Following a meeting</b></p> <p>Any documentation prepared as a result of the meeting should be in Polish, particularly invoices and contracts. Faxed signatures are not permitted. Original copies of documents and signatures are requested in some instances by customs authorities if you are importing or exporting goods.</p>"

      "title": "Motivating Others",
      "body": " <p>One of the challenges in motivating Poles is introducing the concept that salaries should be fairly earned and should be based on job descriptions. There tends to be a strong element of expecting something simply because someone else has got it, rather than expecting to earn it. Having said this, a proper retention policy is essential within any company as the competition for the best skilled workers is intensifying.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227102/pid-2080185-227102-704251357.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">As well as money,&nbsp;Polish workers are motivated by job security. The country has high unemployment and there is sometimes a concern about the long-term strategy of any Western investor. Communicating clearly with employees and reassuring them about the future are very important. Setting clear goals is also an important issue; while a Polish team may take on a task with great enthusiasm, they may find it hard to maintain the momentum. A good manager will use motivation techniques to keep this going.</p> <p>Otherwise, typical employee perks for managers in Poland include life insurance, disability insurance, pension provision and private medical care. Private pensions and medical care are likely to increase as more becomes available on the market. Other perks like childcare, gym membership and company cars are less common, although a company car carries enormous prestige and the presence of a number of leasing companies in Poland means this is beginning to take off as a perk.</p> <p>One thing investors in Poland find very difficult is absenteeism. Poles have been found in surveys to take three times as much sick leave as&nbsp;some other European&nbsp;workers, largely because they can. Polish workers are entitled to 35 days' paid sick leave a year, which is often taken as extra 'holiday'. Encouraging and rewarding good attendance is important to reduce labour costs, but will involve massive cultural change.</p>"

It can take time to establish your credibility in Poland, as business is dependent on personal trust. So a presentation is the ideal way to start off a relationship, introducing yourself, your company and your ideas or product.</p> <p>A high-tech PowerPoint presentation will impress a Polish audience, although it is important to make sure that the technology is present to deliver the presentation, particularly a broadband connection and digital projector if you need one. Have slides and promotional material translated into Polish and have an interpreter at the presentation, as it is unlikely that everybody will understand English.</p> <p><b>Audience expectations</b></p> <p>Poles are good listeners and in return, they expect you to listen to their needs and show that you have understood.
