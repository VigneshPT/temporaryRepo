Religion is important and for many, particularly outside Dublin, the church is the focal point of the community. Nowadays, though, Ireland has to deal with the conflict between traditional Catholic values, which many see as strongly male-orientated, and the fact that the country (or Dublin, at least) is fast becoming a young, exciting, dynamic cultural melting pot. The Irish are excited by the impact the EU has had on their country, although uneasy about the fact that Dublin is, to many, becoming 'just another big European city' now.</p>"

There is considerable positive feeling about the EU.</p> <p>Ireland also maintains close links with the USA where there is a significant Irish American population. Ireland's diaspora spreads all over the world and the country maintains close links with Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Diplomatic relations are maintained with more than 100 countries, with 43 Irish embassies abroad.</p> <p>The country is renowned for its excellent quality of life, its clean environment and its open and supportive attitude to inward investors. Its people are strongly influenced by a rich tradition of literature, music and dance, all of which shape Ireland's cultural life today. Ireland is also known as the youngest country in Europe; the structure of the Irish population is such that the availability of a young work force is likely to continue well into the next century. In the year 2000, 40% of people in Ireland were under 25 years of age; this compares with the European average of approximately 30%.</p>"

The Irish are a gregarious, talkative, competitive people and sport as a spectator and participation event is important to them.</p> <p>Popular activities include: <ul> <li><img style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 10px\" alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227090/pid-2080176-227090-704241418.jpg\" align=\"right\" border=\"1\">Gaelic football and hurling: Uniquely Irish sports such as hurling and Gaelic football are widely played and followed throughout Ireland today, and they have long been part of the Irish experience; Gaelic football dates to at least the seventeenth century and hurling has been played in one form or another for over one thousand years. </li><li>Football (or soccer) </li><li>Camogie (another uniquely Irish sport) </li><li>Horse racing: a big spectator sport. Ireland also has a strong tradition of breeding racehorses. </li><li>Socialising in pubs: The pub is traditionally the favoured place for socialising and 'going for a pint' is something of a national pastime. There are over 10,000 pubs in Ireland, many offering live traditional and modern music as well as pub food. </li><li>Storytelling: Four winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature came from Ireland - W.B. Yeats, George Bernard Shaw, Samuel Beckett and most recently (1995) the poet Seamus Heaney. Other famous Irish writers and poets include James Joyce, Flann O'Brien, Oscar Wilde, Jonathan Swift, Patrick Kavanagh and Brendan Behan. Modern Irish writers with global recognition include Maeve Binchy, Deirdre Purcell, Marian Keyes and Roddy Doyle. Contemporary Irish dramatists include Brian Friel, Tom Kilroy, Tom Murphy, Frank McGuinness, Sebastian Barry, Martin McDonagh and Conor McPherson. </li><li>Visiting friends and family: Many Irish Catholic families are large and family ties are strong. </li><li>Watching television and film: Indigenously produced films began to appear in the 1970s, directed by filmmakers Bob Quinn, Joe Comerford, Cathal Black, Pat Murphy and Thaddeus O'Suillivan. More contemporary filmmakers who have achieved international success include Neil Jordan, Jim Sheridan, Noel Pearson and Gerry Stembridge. Irish actors like Maureen O'Hara, Richard Harris, Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell, Brenda Fricker, Gabriel Byrne, Pearse Brosnan, Fionnuala Flanagan, Aidan Quinn and Stephen Rea have all pursued or are pursuing successful international careers. </li><li>Socialising with singing and dancing: Music is an intrinsic part of Irish culture from the traditional Irish song and ballads in the past to our world famous modern musicians such as U2, Van Morrison and The Corrs. Dancing has always been part of Ireland's culture and traditional dance has been revolutionised by the success of Riverdance.</li></ul> </p><p></p>"

Socialising plays a big part in Irish business life. Family life is highly valued. When building trust with you, the Irish will want to know about you , \"the whole person\" not just your business role. </li><li>Networking is also very important. Your Irish counterparts will assist you in networking at first and you are expected to make use of these new relationships. Failure to do so will be noticed. </li><li>The business community is small and close-knit, so be careful what you say and to whom. </li><li>The Irish like a combination of hard facts and technical knowledge as well as eloquent presentations and arguments. </li><li>The Irish find arguments and opinionated conversation entertaining so don't hesitate to express your views as long as they are sincere and well-informed. </li><li>Even though most Irish business people will admit that locally there is a relaxed attitude to time in many situations, it is still advisable to be punctual. But manage your expectations accordingly and do not get frustrated at 'minor' delays. </li><li>The Irish are tough negotiators; do not be fooled by their apparent relaxed attitude and friendly nature. </li><li>Cynicism is an important part of the national character. The Irish hold a great respect for the \"underdog\" (the one in a contest who is expected to lose!) so it is best to stay modest about your personal achievements until a relationship has been established. </li><li>The Irish are quick to criticize themselves but are not always open to criticism from others. If there is a conflict in the workplace, it is advisable to discuss it one-to-one.</li></ol> </p><p></p>"

Being at ease and friendly, and being a good social mixer helps; socialising around work is important and business in Ireland is conducted around a tight network of family members and friends. To get on, it is essential to join clubs and societies, and attend networking events and conventions and get to meet people. If you are invited to the pub, accept and remember to buy your round of drinks. After-work drinking is a big part of Irish culture ('craic'). </p> <p>Show respect for Ireland's history, Catholicism and sense of patriotism.

      "body": " <p>Business etiquette in Ireland is relatively informal and relaxed, with a tendency to take things slowly, get to know people, socialise with them and to make small talk. Hospitality plays an important role in building a business relationship, and however casual the socialising seems, your Irish counterparts will be summing you up continuously. Networking is an essential part of business life.</p> <p><b>Business cards</b></p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227090/pid-2080161-227090-704241417.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Business cards should be exchanged but it's not necessary to make a big deal about your academic qualifications. You are more likely to be assessed at face value and do not want to be perceived as arrogant or boastful. It is normal to exchange business cards at the end of a meeting. There is no particular ritual governing their presentation.</p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>As in many North European cultures, personal space is valued. Do not stand too close to someone. Maintain eye contact with the person you are talking to. Not looking someone in the eye may cause you to come across as suspicious. Be lively, open and demonstrative but above all, genuine. Touching someone's arm or grabbing their hand may take them by surprise and unnerve them.</p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>Communication in Irish businesses is a mixture of clear and explicit when it comes to making an important point, and implicit when someone is trying to avoid stating a fact or giving a negative answer. There is a tendency to avoid upsetting somebody by saying 'no'. You will probably observe that the Irish are far more animated speakers than the English. Moreover, they can sometimes be described as prone to the legendary national pastime of 'blarney', that is, embellishing the truth. In the course of a conversation, you may have to think critically, to discern the plausibility of what you are being told. Listen carefully and read between the lines. </p> <p><b>Gift giving</b></p> <p>It is not expected that business visitors will bring gifts. The Irish will value your contribution to 'good craic' above any&nbsp;gift you may bring. If, however, you are invited to a person's house for a meal, a bottle of wine, flowers or chocolate are appropriate. An illustrated book from your home region could be another welcome gift. As the saying goes \"It's the thought that counts\", and here your thoughtful choice will be considered far more important than the size or cost of the gift.</p>"

      "body": " <p>Irish business thrives on face-to-face meetings, and the exchange of ideas and input from foreigners is welcomed (although not necessarily trusted). Because of this it is relatively easy to arrange meetings at all levels within a company. Do not, however, expect the meeting to run to a strict agenda. Meetings are seen as discussion forums rather than a gathering which is expected to generate a result, and participants may relish digressing at length. Often during meetings, interesting ideas, the more abstract and theoretical the better, are considered worthier of consideration than empirical data and other hard facts. </p> <p><b>Planning a meeting</b></p> <p>The Irish business community can be something of a closed shop, with family and close professional contacts forming a <img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227090/pid-2080164-227090-704241417.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">close-knit network that can be hard to penetrate. If you have an introduction from the inside, use it. Once you have been accepted, your relationship should be long-lasting.</p> <p>Treat the secretaries of senior executives with respect. Getting on with the assistant will get you through the door. Make an appointment a couple of weeks before travelling to Ireland and reconfirm it when you get there. Although the Irish are very relaxed, you should turn up on time, even if the person you are meeting is late. You must appear reliable and your counterpart will be assessing you from the first moment.</p> <p><b>During a Meeting </b></p> <p>Although meetings tend to get going swiftly, a certain amount of small talk is appreciated. Lively debate is considered a good thing. Certain subjects are taboo, though, including the Catholic Church and its influence, the position with the English in Northern Ireland, and immigration.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you need conversation topics to kick off the small talk, the beauty of Ireland, music and most important, sport, particularly horses, will all go down well.</p> <p>Aggressive sales techniques are not usually welcomed; any meeting will look at the positive and negative aspects of a situation, so if you are making grandiose statements and claims, expect them to be followed up. Generally speaking, though, the Irish are a cynical race and you may come across objections to any suggestion of change, or&nbsp;ambitious plans.</p> <p>Expect to have to negotiate hard. The Irish drive a tough bargain. </p> <p><b>Following a meeting </b></p> <p>Follow up in writing - Irish companies are quite formal in this respect - and stay in touch. Once you are involved with an Irish company, expect it to be on a personal as well as professional level. Maintaining the relationship is very important, as is developing any network of contacts that may have sprung from the meeting. The business community is tight-knit and feedback, both positive and negative, travels around very quickly.</p>"

Be careul about terms, though. Ireland is not called Eire in Ireland, it is called Ireland. Never refer to Britain as 'the mainland'. Remember that Ireland more than ever sees itself as part of Europe now and that the historic ties to Britain are loosening.</p> <p><b>Audience Expectations</b></p> <p>The Irish tend to be polite, attentive listeners, and will restrain themselves from interrupting.&nbsp; At times, there is a tendency to demand convincing evidence, while on other occasions, to accept things on faith. But generally speaking, the Irish are both deductive and associative thinkers. The way things are done, the time, reason, and circumstances, are generally far more important than the result.

Recognition and positive feedback are important, too, although people do not necessarily expect to be singled out for praise. Delivering criticism is another matter and the Irish have a fairly strong sense of 'face'. Negative feedback is rarely given directly and bluntly. Conflict does, of course, occur, but should not be confused with the lively discussion that is part of the Irish love of talk and debate.</p> <p>Coaching and mentoring are important in Ireland and many companies have sophisticated schemes, as well as investing in training.
