Oil brought great wealth to the country, which was subsequently squandered by corrupt leaders. The country's fortunes have since risen and fallen with the oil price and although Venezuela sits on huge reserves, there is still a huge gulf between rich and poor. </p> <p>As such, Venezuelans are highly political. The working classes, those worst affected by the oil boom, are deeply supportive of the extreme left wing president, Hugo Chavez, whose social reforms are changing the face of business with a large-scale nationalisation programme. </p> <p>Venezuela is a predominantly Catholic country. The family forms the basis of most relationships and the cornerstone of most people's lives, with strong loyalties carrying over into the workplace. Business is highly personal in Venezuela and moves at a slower pace than in the USA or Europe, but on the other hand, this is a culture of entrepreneurs who admire wealth and have a strong entrepreneurial streak. </p> "

      "body": "<p>Despite vast tracts of virgin rainforest and huge expanses of plains and grasslands, Venezuela is among the most highly urbanised countries in Latin America. Venezuela has some of the world's largest proven oil deposits as well as huge quantities of coal, iron ore, bauxite and gold and is extremely wealthy, but also in some areas, suffering the effects of corruption at high levels.</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/228798/pid-2080164-228798-802261651.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">The Venezuelan people make up a rich combination of heritages. The original Amerindians, Spanish colonists and Africans were joined by Italians, Portuguese, Arabs, Germans, and others from neighbouring countries in South America during waves of immigration in the 20th century.</p> <p>About 85% of the population lives in urban areas in the northern portion of the country. While almost half of Venezuela's land area lies south of the Orinoco river, this region contains only 5% of the population.</p> <p>There are extremes between rich and poor and many people live in huge shanty towns sprawling over the hillsides around Caracas, the capital. Yet there is an inherent belief that power brings with it privileges and entitlement, and people look up to strong, charismatic, powerful leaders. </p> <p>Controversial left-wing president Hugo Chavez claims to be taking Venezuela through a socialist revolution but despite his socialist values, Venezuelan business culture is still dominated by the white, elite upper class and the means of production, distribution, transport and sales of goods in many industries are in the hands of a few oligarchs. </p> <p>As well as the white elite, there is a large mestizo population, and a small black population. There is some bias against the native Indian population, who do not generally thrive in Venezuelan society. </p>"

Soccer is also gaining popularity, due to the increasing performance of the Venezuela national football team. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/228798/pid-2080179-228798-802261651.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Other popular sports include canyoning, horse riding on the high Paramo grasslands, paragliding and hiking. In the north, people go to the beach at weekends. In the south, there are various rainforest resorts and hiking centres where people will go camping or stay in jungle lodges.</p> <p>Although North American music is popular and widespread in Venezuela, the Caribbean salsa and merengue forms are also commonly heard. The national Venezuelan folk dance and musical style is the Joropo. Dancing is a popular evening activity and it's common for Venezuelans, in cities especially, to stay up very late. </p> <p>Family is very important in Venezuela and even in the big cities, individuals will join large family gatherings at weekends, for dinner, occasional meals out, picnics in local parks or simply in a cafe. Caracas has a lively cultural scene, with opera, pop and classical concerts, museums and art galleries, theatre and clubs. Venezuelan women in particular are keen consumers and spend a lot of time shopping, but in the countryside, life is obviously more simple and moves at a slower pace.</p> <p>Venezuela has several occasions during the year involving great festivity: carnival, just before Lent, when there are parades and a great deal of partying; Holy Week, which is a more sombre occasion; and the period leading up to Christmas and between Christmas and New Year, when most businesses close and everybody heads for the beach. </p>"

The gulf between rich and poor is enormous and the middle classes tend to hold the ruling elite in high esteem. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/228798/pid-2080185-228798-802261651.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Venezuelans work well in teams and are generally supportive of one another. Positive feedback is welcome; negative feedback may be taken as a direct, personal criticism rather than something constructive. </p> <p>Business is highly personal in Venezuela and anybody hoping to work here should network as much as possible, via trade associations, social events and by using an enchufado, a local intermediary who can make introductions. Venezuelans like to work with people they know; despite their enjoyment of making money, they are generally risk-averse. To this end, face-to-face meetings and a strong physical presence in the country are important. Having a local representative is not enough; you should visit often to renew personal contacts. </p>"

Be on time for meetings, respect the hierarchy and always appear polite and calm. </p> <p>Learning Spanish is tremendously helpful as business will almost always be conducted in Spanish. Even if you still need an interpreter, a few words and phrases will please your Venezuelan counterparts. </p> <p>Business entertaining is important and you should always invite someone for lunch if you have a morning meeting, and for dinner to further cement the relationship. Always offer coffee to visitors at meetings and make time for them. Demonstrate your commitment to Venezuela with a physical presence in the country, not just a local agent. </p> <p>You will probably need to set generous deadlines for projects and keep a close eye on them, but you should never appear impatient or aggressive in your desire to get things done.

A lot of emphasis is placed on titles so make sure your card states your full job title. Less is not more in this case. It's not necessary to have your card translated into Spanish unless you have a particularly complex job title.</p> <p>Business cards of others should be treated with care and respect. Read someone's card before filing it carefully in a card holder, not stuffing it in your pocket.</p> <p><strong>Body Language</strong></p> <p>Venezuelans are very expressive and are animated in their conversations. They stand closer than North Americans are accustomed to and sometimes grab the arm of the person they are addressing to make a point. Do not back away when someone talks at close range and maintain eye contact to show your attentiveness.</p> <p><strong>Communication Style</strong></p> <p>Communication is more direct than in some Latin American cultures and a Venezuelan will say no and mean no, albeit in a way that will not cause offence. It is considered rude to express very strong or personal opinions with people you do not know well. Language tends to be flowery and elaborate and a Venezuelan will typically take a long time to get to the point.</p> <p><strong>Gift Giving</strong></p> <p>Exchange of small business gifts is perfectly acceptable and expected and will not be interpreted as a bribe. Something tasteful with a discreet logo, or a good bottle of wine or spirits is appropriate. Anything larger may be misconstrued, so be careful and always respect your company's policies, the laws of your country and the laws of Venezuela regarding bribery. </p>"

Try not to have meetings planned for Friday afternoons as people may be heading for the coast for the weekend and will be either distracted or simply won't turn up. Also avoid the days before a national holiday, when the same may apply. </p> <p><strong>During a Meeting</strong></p> <p>The point of a meeting is for discussion and the exchange of ideas. If your Spanish is not very good, it's important to bring an interpreter as Venezuelans tend all to talk at once and you may lose the thread of the conversation. </p> <p>Expect people to turn up on time and if you are attending a meeting but not hosting it, you, too, should be on time and even early. </p> <p>Offer coffee and biscuits as refreshment when people arrive. You can draw up an agenda but it may not be stuck to and discussions may be circular rather than working through a list of topics. </p> <p><strong>After a Meeting</strong></p> <p>Follow up in writing, reiterating points that were discussed and any action plan. If you are hosting a meeting, it is advisable to invite your counterparts out for lunch or dinner afterwards - and if you're being hosted, accept any invitations they offer to you.</p>"

Venezuelans have a desire to please and succeed, but are not known for being especially ambitious.

Be fully prepared and practice your speech so that you come across as articulate and fluent. </p> <p>Maintain eye contact with the audience and appear friendly but professional. If there is someone in the room who is obviously senior, make more eye contact with them than with the other attendees. </p> <p>If at all possible, make your speech in Spanish, even if you use an interpreter for the Q&A session at the end.</p> <p><strong>Audience expectations</strong></p> <p>Venezuelans can easily become distracted and a speaker will have to be extremely charismatic to hold the attention of an audience for a long time.
