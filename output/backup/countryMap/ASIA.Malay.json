Different ethnic groups (mainly Chinese, Malay and Indian) live side-by-side but have different religions, work ethics, aspirations and values. Letting each group fall into its own stereotype is all too easy - the Chinese are driven and ambitious, the Malays are more laid-back and more devout, Indians are good business people, although this does not apply to all Chinese or all Malays or Indians, naturally. </p> <p>Malaysians are proud their country and the success they have attained. They still, however, generally identify themselves first with respect to their ethnic background ahead of identifying themselves as Malaysian. This is a long way from the vision of former Prime Minister Dr Mahathir, whose famous Vision 2020, launched in the 1980s, set Malaysia a goal of becoming fully ethnically integrated, and a developed, not developing country, by 2020. Vision 2020 followed on from the Five Principles of Nationhood, or Rukunegara, which was formulated after violent racial riots of May 13, 1969, in an attempt to base the national philosophy on unity and progressiveness (as a whole), whereby concepts which are universal and acceptable to all Malaysian citizens, regardless of ethnic origin or religious affiliation, were adopted as the ideology of the country. It could be argued that both plans have enjoyed some success; although Malaysia's ethnic groups are not particularly integrated, they do live together harmoniously, which is more than some of Malaysia's neighbours have achieved.</p> <p>Malaysia is officially a Muslim country (although the Chinese and Indians are not Muslim), with Islam the official religion. The country follows the tenets of Islam, although it is not as strict as some of the Arab nations and has a thriving tourism industry based mainly around beach life. Most Malays are devout and although the Islamic influence has shown signs of getting stronger, the last elections, in 2004, showed a clear swing away from radical Islamic politicians, with the voting public's strongest concern to be ironing out corruption.</p>"

While the cities are populous, there is a strong rural population as well. Young people may move to the city or abroad to look for work, but will maintain contact with family back in the village. Large family gatherings are very common, with people often travelling a long way to reach them.</p> <p>Different ethnic groups tend to live in separate areas, not by design, but by natural process. Thus, each city will have a Chinatown district, and an Indian district. </p> <p>Malay families tend to be quite large. Under the law of Islam, men are allowed to practice polygamy and may have up to four wives, for 'compassionate' reasons, although the man has to seek permission from his existing wife or wives to take another. Chinese families are much smaller.</p> <p>Although the professional split between the different ethnic groups is becoming more even, it can still be said that the Chinese control the bulk of business in Malaysia, while farmers and fishermen are still mainly ethnic Malays.</p>"

Many people play musical instruments, the traditional kompang (like a tambourine) one of the most popular, used at everything from weddings to football matches. There are numerous elaborate folk dances, a tradition kept <img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227095/pid-2080173-227095-704251029.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">very much alive for family celebrations and official events. The Chinese community includes many lion dance troupes, which are in high demand during the 15 days of Chinese New Year.</p> <p>Malaysia has a number of festivals and celebrations, some of which are celebrated as public holidays, either nationwide or specific to a few states. Most of these festivals are either religious or cultural in origin, and are swathed in traditions and rituals. Religion is no barrier to a festival being celebrated by all, and everything from Hari Raya Puasa (the end of Ramadan) to Chinese New Year, the Hindu festival of Deepavali and Christmas are observed.</p> <p>Other leisure interests include football (watching and playing), shopping, movies, theatre and golf (among rich men). But great emphasis is given during leisure time to family and friends, with large gatherings in people's houses, or in a restaurant. The mamak stall, a kind of pavement caf&eacute;, has become a permanent fixture in many parts of Malaysia, especially within the state of Selangor, particularly in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya and is popular among young adults and teenagers who look at these stalls as a place to gather with friends to while the night away, as an alternative to a nightclub. </p> <p>Malaysians will travel great distances to be with family on special occasions. The exodus on public holidays from the cities is known as \"balik kampung\", or \"to go back to one's hometown\". </p>"

      "body": " <p>There are three principal ethnic groups in Malaysia, with different cultural backgrounds and attitudes. The Chinese used to dominate the business sector, with the ethnic Malays more focused on farming and fishing, and the Indians as shop and plantation workers. This has all changed since the government's affirmative action programme, introduced in the late 1960s, to boost the position of Malays in business and in universities. The programme has been partially successful, although many Chinese Malays are now forced to go to university abroad because of the high quotas of lesser-qualified ethnic Malays being accepted in universities. The Indians, broadly speaking, have become the new underclass.</p> <p>The ease of working with the Malays depends on the cultural background of the company's owners. The Chinese tend to be businesslike and efficient, while ethnic Malays are more focused on relationship-building. Malays are Muslim and time for prayer must always be accounted for - a meeting, for example, may be interrupted while everybody goes to the mosque, or the prayer room. Both groups are typically Asian in that the concepts of loyalty to the family, respect for elders and saving face are very important to them. Both are high-context communicators and both groups are enthusiastic team players. Malays are becoming increasingly materialistic as their society heads towards one of a developed, rather than developing country, but are still highly loyal to their leader, putting the good of the team before personal goals.</p>"

Dress respectfully (take the lead from your Malaysian counterparts) and use politeness in your tone, showing special respect for older and more senior people. <img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227095/pid-2080176-227095-704251029.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Malaysians are quite formal and their social and business hierarchies must be observed.</p> <p>Tread carefully through the social minefield of people's religions and taboos, bearing in mind that you may be dealing with a devout Muslim, Buddhist or Hindu. This means observing the correct protocol regarding gifts, body language, menus while entertaining and consumption of alcohol.</p> <p>Do not appear to be in a hurry when negotiating, as it will be used as a weapon against you. Don't press for a quick decision and don't focus on the bottom line or the short term. Malaysia is all about forming lasting business relationships. Tread carefully around certain conversation topics, particularly government, corruption and race issues. Remember that Malaysians are very patriotic and proud of their country, and are conditioned not to question authority. They are also very welcoming to foreign investors, particularly in the IT sector, and pride themselves in being technologically advanced.</p>"

Business cards should be embossed and promotional material printed in English. Since many business people in Malaysia are Chinese, it might be worth translating the information into Chinese on the reverse side of your business card.</p> <p><b>Communication style</b></p> <p>Malaysians use a lot of indirect communication and will make saving 'face' a priority over being blunt and truthful. </p> <p>When asked for a favour, Malaysians will usually avoid saying \"no,\" as to do so causes embarrassment and loss of face. If a request cannot be met, Malaysians may say it is inconvenient or under consideration. The Malaysians have the habit of telling a person whatever they believe he or she wants to hear, whether or not it is true.</p> <p>If bad news needs to be told, they will be reluctant to break it. Sometimes they will use an intermediary for communication, or perhaps they will imply bad news without being blunt.</p> <p><b>Body language</b></p> <p>Malaysians tend to be reserved in their use of body language and are not given to wild gestures of huge displays of emotion. Visitors should behave in the same way to avoid making their hosts feel uncomfortable.</p> <p>Handshaking in Malaysia is relatively uncommon. Although Malaysians are used to the Western handshake, don't be surprised if the handshake you receive in return is weak by American standards. In fact, do not extend your hand to a Malaysian unless he or she offers first. This is especially true for women. Never touch someone with your left hand, as it's considered unclean. Never expose the soles of your shoes, either by putting them on a table or by crossing your legs. Avoid pointing at anything and if you must, use your entire hand to indicate the object.</p> <p><b>Gift giving</b></p> <p>Only small gifts are usually given, as anything larger may be perceived as bribery and Malaysians are very sensitive about issues of corruption. If you are presented with a gift, it is customary to accept it with both hands and wait until you are alone to open it. Reciprocate with a gift of equal value in order to avoid loss of face. </p> <p>If you are going to meet a company for the first time, take some small but tasteful gifts and keep them in your briefcase, so that if you are unexpectedly given something, nobody will lose face. Quality pens, desk accessories and items representative of your country or city are acceptable. If a man gives a gift to a Malaysian woman, he should say that the gift is from his wife, to avoid the gesture being construed as romantic. If you give a Chinese person a gift, they may refuse it three times, as a sign of politeness.</p> <p>Presenting a gift is complicated. White, blue, black and yellow gift-wrap should be avoided. Red or pink is safest. Give an even number of flowers. Avoid anything with alcohol (including perfume) or pork. Don't take food to a dinner party.</p> <p>At Chinese New Year, it is customary to give a gift of money in a red envelope to children and a tip to anybody else you deal with on a regular basis. You'll see the red envelopes all over shops and homes. This gift is called \"hong bao.\" Give only new bills in even numbers and even amounts. Many employers give each employee a \"hong bao\" equivalent to one month's salary; check whether this is part of the culture in your company.</p>"

You must be prepared for what may seem to be an inordinate amount of small talk and numerous social occasions. </p> <p>Plan the meeting at least two weeks in advance. If it is with Chinese Malays, they will probably turn up reasonably punctually. Ethnic Malays and government officials are likely to have a more relaxed attitude to time and may even cancel with no real explanation.</p> <p>If the meeting is for negotiating, it is polite to let the other party know who will be attending from your side and how senior they are, so a matched negotiating team can be supplied.</p> <p><b>During a meeting</b></p> <p>Expect a formal exchange of business cards and a degree of small talk before the meeting starts. Tea, coffee and soft drinks should be offered.</p> <p>Malaysians might ask what other nationalities consider to be quite personal questions, perhaps about your martial status or your income. If you feel unable to respond to these questions, you should be open about it and explain that these are not topics that are discussed in your country, although in such a way that the other person does not lose face.</p> <p>Malaysians tend to be good, attentive listeners but expect the same politeness from others. Do not interrupt someone while they are making a point and keep the meeting tone formal and respectful. Body language is important, regardless of the ethnic origin of the other party; sitting with legs crossed or in a casual pose, with open-necked shirt is likely to indicate a less than serious attitude to business.</p> <p><b>After the meeting</b></p> <p>It is not really appropriate to extend an impromptu lunch invitation after a meeting. You should let your Malaysian counterparts invite you out first. Nor is it correct to suggest after-work drinks, although Chinese executives in Kuala Lumpur and other big cities may be amenable to this.</p> <p>If a contract has been drawn up, go through it carefully and bear in mind that it may be changed even after signing. If there is a list of action points, circulate it and politely reiterate everybody's task and deadline.</p>"

      "body": " <p>The rapid economic growth of Malaysia under the leadership of its fourth prime minister, Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad, did a lot to encourage a patriotic sense of achievement amongst its people. Dr Mahathir's 'Vision 2020', an ambitious plan that saw Malaysia as a fully developed, economically successful, socially integrated country by 2020, also stirred up a sense of unity among Malaysians. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227095/pid-2080182-227095-704251029.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Embodying this spirit is the slogan \"Malaysia Boleh!\" which loosely translated means \"Malaysia Can Do It!\". \"Malaysia Boleh!\" has now become a kind of battle cry and will be heard at sporting and other competitive events.</p> <p>This sense of patriotism translates to individual companies. If Malaysians have a strong, caring leader, they will be inspired to work better for the good of the team (and the leader), rather than the advancement of the individual. Malaysians are strongly motivated by money as well, of course, but a sense of comfort and belonging in the workplace is very important to them. Many Malaysians do not have a personal career plan, as such, but instead see the future as something vague that will be dictated by the will of God. If they are particularly attached to a leader and that leader moves to another company, they may well follow suit.</p> <p>Pitting teams against one another is not really done in Malaysia as a losing team will also lose face, and a winning team will feel uncomfortable being singled out. Malaysian companies are more likely to foster team spirit with a caring environment - family days, celebration of special anniversaries, light hearted sports days, for example.</p>"
