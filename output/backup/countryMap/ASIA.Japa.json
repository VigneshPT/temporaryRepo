The country is relatively small, with a high population density, and people are accustomed to having little personal space or privacy; 'privacy' is, in fact, an imported word into the Japanese language.</p> <p>There are few natural resources and nearly half of all food is imported.</p> <p>Japanese people are also used to living 'on the edge', having to live with threats of Nature. Three major fault lines run through the country and earthquakes are not uncommon; the devastating Kobe earthquake of 1995 killed 5,500 and left hundreds of thousands homeless.</p>"

Living to work is normal here, and people aspire for the good of their company (an extended family) as well as themselves.</p> <p>The biggest calendar event for the Japanese is the New Year's Festival. The period of celebration is called <i>Shogatsu</i>, which refers to the first month of the year. On the first of January, families gather to drink a <img height=\"133\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227093/pid-2080170-227093-704241526.jpg\" width=\"200\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">particular type of sake that is supposed to ensure a long life, and wipe away any bitter memories remaining from the previous year. Families decorate the entrances to their homes with branches of pine and straw, which symbolically prevent the entrance of impurities. It is also the custom to visit shrines and pray for good fortune in the New Year. Recently, many children spend the day playing video games, but there are still a number who entertain themselves with the traditional New Year's amusements such as kites, battledore, and <i>sugoroku</i>, a Japanese version of Parcheesi.</p> <p>Along with celebrations for Constitution Day, March 3 also brings with it the festivities of the Doll festival, or <i>hina matsuri</i>. On this day, families with girls display a set of dolls representing the ancient imperial court and celebrate by drinking a special kind of sweetened white sake. There is a similar celebration for boys on the fifth of May, <i>Tango no Sekku</i>. Families with boys hang streamers depicting carp outside their homes as symbols of strength, display miniature samurai dolls and armour inside the house, and celebrate with special rice cakes. On the two days out of the year which mark the passing of the vernal and autumnal equinox, it is a commonly practiced Buddhist tradition for people to pay respect to their passed relatives at their gravesites.</p> <p>While women in Japan engage in, on average, three hours and nineteen minutes more housework a day than men, both men and women enjoy a relatively equal amount of time per day for tertiary activities such as hobbies and amusements. The following list catalogues the most popular recreational activities in Japan: <ol> <li>Eating out </li><li>Driving (to cooler or warmer locations; hot springs, etc.) </li><li>Travel within Japan </li><li>Karaoke </li><li>Watching videos </li><li>Listening to music </li><li>Zoos, botanical gardens, aquariums, or museums </li><li>Bars, pubs and other drinking spots </li><li>Gardening </li><li>Movies</li></ol> </p><p></p> <p>For men, golf is part of the job.

      "body": " <p>Meetings, like every other aspect of Japanese culture, are governed by strict protocol which must be observed if the proposition is even to stand a chance.</p> <p><b>Planning a meeting</b></p> <p>It is considered inappropriate to bring more people to a meeting than was previously discussed. The Japanese like to equate their staff to that of the <img height=\"110\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227093/pid-2080161-227093-704241526.jpg\" width=\"220\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">foreign team in order to ensure a balanced environment. Your team should be identical to the biographical list you sent prior to your arrival. If extenuating circumstances make this impossible, inform the Japanese team, or at least bring the same number of people. </p> <p>Prior to the meeting itself, it is best to send your Japanese counterparts a hierarchical list with brief biographical information of your team. Also send any information (preferably translated into Japanese) that you intend to cover in the meeting.&nbsp; This helps them prepare a team comparable and well-matched to your own. </p> <p><b>During a meeting</b></p> <p>The Japanese team will generally arrive a few minutes early, you should do likewise. Punctuality is highly valued in Japanese business culture.</p> <p>The suffix 'san' has the English meaning of Mr and Mrs. Mr. Kawase would become Kawase-san. Mr. Kawase-san would be redundant. It should be noted that a superior does not use this form of address to his subordinates. If the leader of a Japanese team is not using it, this does not mean you should not either. Remember 'san' cannot be used about yourself.</p> <p>As a guest, you should sit on the seat furthest from the door (seat of honour). You may have expected a one-on-one meeting with your counterpart, but one-on-one meetings are rare. The practice is to have groups facing each other. Don't try to break up the ranks of the Japanese. The leader of the Japanese group must be shown great respect.&nbsp;The&nbsp;leader&nbsp;may do little talking in the meeting (talking will be done by assistants). Subordinates are likely to dominate planning discussions until it is time for a decision.</p> <p>It is important to develop a friendly relationship from the very beginning of the encounter. Do not complain about the weather, hotel, or trip from the West. Say only positive things, and provide personal anecdotes when possible. Do not rush. Let them initiate the business discussion when they see fit. Also bear in mind that silence is not only OK, it is valued. If there is an awkward silent pause, let them break it. The Japanese do not like the hard sell. They tend to meet force with great intransigence. Treated with respect, they are often willing to be very flexible.</p> <p>You first need to adjust your expectations. Most meetings in Japan are for stating positions, gathering information, or expressing agreement to decisions already made behind the scenes. The Japanese look at issues in clusters rather than one at a time. They will look at the whole and the interrelationships between factors rather than each piece sequentially. This can be time consuming, so be patient.</p> <p>Meetings tend to reinforce the achievement of consensus rather than seek to develop it. Of 300 Western business people surveyed, 37.3% said that the aspect of Japanese business they find hardest to understand is the fact that many meetings never reach a final conclusion.</p> <p>During meetings, take extensive and clear notes giving a general outline of the decisions reached thus far. This is so you can periodically present them your Japanese counterpart and ensure both sides have a good understanding of one another. The Japanese are likely to make detailed notes (they want to maximise their time in the meeting and capture data). Do not criticise your own company in the presence of the Japanese. They will assume you lack integrity&nbsp;- &nbsp;you are your company. Don't introduce topics or information that will be a surprise.</p> <p><b>Following a meeting</b></p> <p>If you are waiting for a decision to be made by your Japanese colleagues, be prepared to wait a longer time than you would in the West. Consensus will have to be achieved among the Japanese. It is best to write a thank-you note for their consideration and hospitality while you await their response. Thank-you notes are highly valued in Japan and ensure cordial relations.</p>"

      "body": " <p>The primary motivation of the Japanese is avoidance of social embarrassment by fulfilling the expectations of others. The need is to avoid the appearance of inferiority.

Job titles are important and great motivators. Many companies have layers of hierarchical positions to keep employees who won't make it to the very top motivated. The desire to avoid embarrassment can be seen in the Japanese pre-emptive apology. Before making a presentation, the Japanese will apologise for their lack of skill and preparation. This helps reduce the possibility that the presenter will fail to meet audience expectations. The Japanese will also apologise before giving a gift. The emphasis on process rather than outcomes also protects managers from looking foolish. If the correct process was followed, the manager is protected from personal blame. A stress on relatively long-term goals also deflects the possibility of failure and embarrassment.</p>"
