Following this, the country was an American unincorporated territory for 37 years. Both episodes have had a profound influence on Filipino culture today, creating a nation of people who identify ethnically as Malay but speak a language peppered with Spanish words and demonstrate a penchant for all things American. The business culture is essentially Western and the Filipinos, talkative and demonstrative, appear almost Western. Conversely, other aspects of their culture are distinctly Asian. These include their group-orientated culture, the importance of family and the concept of \"face\".</p> <p>Filipinos use the phrase Halo-Halo, or mix-mix, to identify themselves. Halo-halo is actually a sweet concoction of preserved beans, coconut meat, jackfruit, sweet yam, leche flan, crushed ice and coconut milk. Centuries of inter-island migration and intermarriage, combined with the American and Spanish influences are accurately summed up by this metaphor.</p>"

Manila, the capital, is the largest city but there are other major population centres, including Cebu in the south, often known as the \"second capital\".</p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227101/pid-2080167-227101-704251325.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Filipino culture is strongly group-orientated and people are content to live in close proximity to others. Family is of paramount importance, as is the Catholic faith (except in the Muslim south). Filipinos will do everything in groups; if a bus is due to leave and is full, people will sit on one another's laps rather than let the bus leave somebody behind. Family celebrations spread out into the street and carry on over a period of days; festivals have pre- and post- celebrations and extend over weeks. Despite relative poverty, Filipinos celebrate regularly, with singing and dancing at every social event.</p> <p>Filipinos are also great travellers and great linguists. They migrate all over the world, usually to earn money to send home rather than to experience living abroad. They pick up foreign languages quickly and their inherently cheerful nature and strong service ethic makes them highly successful in the hospitality industry. </p> <p>The next biggest social frame after the family is the barrio (in rural areas) or the barangay (in administrative language). There are about 40,000 barangays in the Philippines - nearly 5,000 in Metro Manila alone. The word 'barangay' is Malay in origin and originally meant the number of people who could be carried in a large boat. Barrio and barangay are used interchangeably and correspond roughly to the American precinct or the English parish. Each as a concept was implemented by the Marcos administration and kept thereafter.</p> <p>The barangay is the smallest government unit in the Philippines and each municipality or city is sub-divided in this manner. It is the primary planning and action unit for government programmes and projects. It is a forum for the collective opinion of a community.</p> <p>To qualify each barangay must have a basketball court, a chapel, a plaza, a health centre (which must have a refrigerator to store anti-snake bite sera), a barangay hall and a school.</p>"

Singing and dancing happen spontaneously; many Filipinos are naturally talented musicians.</p> <p>Filipinos are also keen on sport, particularly basketball, a legacy of American rule. Beach life and watersports are popular as all Filipinos live within easy reach of the sea. </p> <p>They are keen travellers, although they tend to venture abroad to find work and send money home rather than to take holidays. </p> <p>In Manila and Cebu, life is as it would be in any huge metropolis with bars, restaurants, shopping malls and nightclubs. Elsewhere, however, the pace is slower, keeping more with life on a tropical island.</p>"

Only after establishing a cordial atmosphere will people negotiate. No matter what the final result, any discussions should always end cheerfully. To a Filipino - cultivating a friend, establishing a valuable contact and developing personal rapport are what make business wheels turn. The Filipino way of doing business is a confluence of the East and West. It is better not to assume that the friendly, chatty Filipino manner is a license to treat business as one does back home - setting tight deadlines, focusing on the bottom line, being more aggressive with your team. Despite the American influence, Asian values are still deeply ingrained.</p> <p>Doing business can be deeply frustrating. Decisions take a long time to be made. Filipinos can appear very enthusiastic about projects and ideas but many will never get off the ground. Projects will be started but will lose their momentum. Teams tend to be dragged down to the lowest common denominator and may make progress slowly. Western managers have to adjust to the culture and allow people to save face, making it difficult to discipline anybody. It may be easier to move somebody to another department rather than to fire them. </p>"

If men are going to wear a barong tagalog (the loose-fitting white shirt worn by Filipino men), it should be without irony and is probably best saved for follow-up meetings; it's a bit much to turn up at an initial meeting in national dress. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227101/pid-2080179-227101-704251325.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Respect Filipino etiquette; address people correctly and understand the signs that indicate you have been accepted.

      "body": " <p>Business cards are exchanged at the beginning of a meeting. Sometimes a Filipino prints his or her home number on a business card, which indicates that it is acceptable to call them outside office hours. Cards only need to be printed in English. Although their exchange is more casual than in, say, Japan or Korea, it is nonetheless polite to study the card carefully before putting it in your pocket. When dealing with Muslim Filipinos remember not to present a card with your left hand since it is considered unclean.</p> <p><strong>Body language</strong></p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227101/pid-2080161-227101-704251325.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Filipinos are a touching people and are constantly connecting with one another, either holding hands, embracing or touching someone to illustrate a point. People talk to one another in close proximity. </p> <p>Filipinos have complicated nonverbal language, much of it involving facial expressions. Lifting the eyebrows without smiling means no -- but lifting the eyebrows while smiling is used to greet a friend. Filipinos often point by pursing their lips. Pointing your finger is rude and you should avoid too-direct eye contact. Make eye contact during introductions but break it throughout conversations. Holding eye contact for long periods of time is intimidating and it's important not to cause a counterpart to lose face by embarrassing him in any way. </p> <p>The rules on handshakes are similar to those in the West - although Filipinos may use a little more contact (a pat on the side of the arm as gesture of hospitality or friendship) and have a weaker handshake than Westerners. If there is a clear status differential or you are meeting a senior executive, it may be best to let him/her offer the handshake first. Do not make any other physical contact with a senior person, like grabbing their arm or slapping them on the back.</p> <p>Raising one's voice is unacceptable in Filipino business culture. It's important to maintain a low, yet controlled tone of voice at all times. Striving to speak this way can help you conduct business with greater effectiveness and may even allow you to project more of an authoritative, confident image.</p> <p>Don't assume that a smile is an indication of amusement or approval. Frequently, smiling is used to mask embarrassment, nervousness, and other feelings of distress. This is why you will sometimes observe Filipinos smiling or laughing during inappropriately sombre or tense moments. </p> <p>Because of the years of U.S. military presence in the Philippines, most North American gestures are recognised and understood. You may observe people hissing in restaurants; this is a common way of beckoning waiters.</p> <p><strong>Communication style</strong></p> <p>Despite the Western influences on their culture, Filipinos are indirect communicators and will rarely use the word 'no'. Given the cultural value of pakikisama (group loyalty) and the importance of maintaining social harmony, disagreement or interpersonal tension of any sort is distasteful. As a result, business negotiations often have far more ambiguity than the typical Westerner is used to. Yes does not always mean yes, but could mean maybe, or be used simply to keep you quiet. There are words in Tagalog that don't say no, but do imply it. For example, the word mamaya implies \"later today\" while saka na means more like \"sometime later... \".</p> <p>This reluctance to say no comes across in other ways as well. A Filipino may not take your calls or may cancel meetings (by being 'out' when you arrive) rather than looking you in the eye and saying 'no'. Getting decisions made can be frustrating.</p> <p>Another characteristic of Filipino communication is ningas cogon, an idiomatic phrase referring to what happens when you set a blazing fire, only to watch it quickly fizzle out. The phrase refers to a rather unfortunate tendency to start projects and never finish them. All too often the projects under discussion never get off the ground as the parties involved move on to other projects. This is usually because some participants were reluctant to show their reservations in the first place; they wanted to go along with the group consensus. While this has the short-term advantage of everyone leaving the meeting full of hope, the longer-term consequences include confusion, frustration, and resentment.</p> <p><strong>Gift-giving</strong></p> <p>Gift-giving is an important part of Filipino culture, particularly at Christmas, when gifts should be given to practically everybody you know, from doorman to office junior, as well as all suppliers and customers. Gifts could range from baskets of goodies to company giveaways to plain calendars or office items with your company logo. </p> <p>In some cultures, gifts are considered bribes but in the Philippines, a business deal often isn't complete until gift exchanges are done. Upon signing of any contracts, if gift exchanges have yet to take place, offer the associates something tasteful but not too expensive and extravagant. Gifts are not opened in front of the giver.</p> <p>Once a contract has been signed, prepare to give your new partners a gift of greater value. These gifts include dinner at a fine restaurant, whisky for men or perfume for women. The gift should still, however, be modest enough not to be construed as a bribe. Respect your company's culture and the laws of your own country and of the Philippines when it comes to gift-giving.</p> <p>When invited to a Filipino home, bring a gift of flowers, candy or chocolates. Another option is to arrange to have these items sent before your arrival. Avoid bringing alcohol or food as these gifts may imply that the hospitality is inadequate. Allowances are made, however, for a speciality dish or food that is unique to your home region. Be sure to send a thank-you note afterwards.</p>"

Do not arrange back-to-back meetings as there is every chance that somebody will be late and the meeting will probably run over schedule. Guests should be offered snacks and drinks (coffee and soft drinks) at the meeting. Filipinos may arrive as a team, rather than one-on-one, so be prepared.

This is an essential part of relationship-building and allows your Filipino counterparts to assess you as somebody to work with and to put you in context. If you are going to be negotiating, make sure your counterparts build relationships with more than one executive from your company, as a safeguard in case one of you cannot make it to future meetings. If one person is pulled off a deal, the relationship-building has to start again.</p> <p>Meetings follow an agenda but may deviate from it. Filipinos tend to be good listeners and will not interrupt. The meeting should strive for harmony and even if you feel passionately about something do not raise your voice or show annoyance. If you must criticise a plan, present it as suggesting an alternative rather than causing somebody to lose face.</p> <p>Always try to demonstrate a long-term commitment to doing business in the Philippines and highlight the benefits of your deal to your Filipino counterparts. Filipinos can be suspicious of people who are only involved in something for their own good. </p> <p><strong>After the meeting</strong></p> <p>More time should be allowed for small talk. It is rude to disappear straight after a meeting and important for the harmony of the group that the meeting should end on a positive note. Follow up any proposals in writing and if you hosted the meeting, distribute minutes to all who were present. From what was discussed, try to sort out in your head things that are likely to happen and those will amount to nothing. Filipinos can get very excited at new plans but sometimes lack the ability to follow them through.</p>"

Do not prepare a speech that relies entirely on an elaborate presentation. Have handouts ready for afterwards, for people to use as notes and as a backup in case the power does fail.</p> <p>Filipinos generally make good, polite, attentive listeners and are used to long, elaborate speeches - sometimes half in English and half in Tagalog. Speakers should come across and warm and friendly, but modest. Don't be afraid to expand on a point and don't expect the audience to interrupt; they will listen and then ask questions later.
