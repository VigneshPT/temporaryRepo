Migrant workers flock here, lured by a life in the sun and a tax-free salary, resulting in an imbalance of a population in which only 20% are native Emiratis. </p> <p>Originally independent oases settled by Bedouin tribes, the Emirates were only formed into the United Arab Emirates in 1971. The barren desert had just been found to conceal vast reserves of oil and natural gas and the Emirates shot to rapid wealth over just 30 years. Today, the desert oases are barely recognisable, with gleaming skyscrapers clustered around the Creek in Dubai and along the Corniche in Abu Dhabi like the Manhattan skyline, and lavish tourist resorts drawing millions a year to the sunny climate, emerald golf courses, extravagant theme parks and vast shopping malls. Conscious that the oil isn't going to last forever (particularly in Dubai), the government has created a huge, high-tech hub for finance, manufacturing and trading. It has been compared to Singapore, Hong Kong, Orlando and Las Vegas. The building boom shows no signs of abating.</p> <p>The result of all this development is a vast influx of migrant workers, with Indians, Pakistanis, Filipinos, Europeans, other Arabs and Australians all thrown into a cultural melting pot. Huge numbers of workers are, however, low-income employees from the Indian subcontinent and the Philippines, finding jobs in the construction industry and domestic service, where they are tied to one employer and stay only to earn money to send home.</p> <p>The UAE is one of the most liberal of the Arab nations and for the executive classes, is considered a desirable place to live, with none of the hardships for ex-pats like those they might face in neighbouring Saudi Arabia. Yet because there is so much wealth, the UAE, particularly Dubai, have been criticised for being materialistic - a collection of people thrown together for convenience, but with little interest in interaction. The different ethnic groups - the powerful Lebanese, Americans, Europeans, Arabs - are inherently suspicious of one another and while they will work together in pursuit of wealth, rarely socialise outside the office.</p> <p>The Emiratis themselves, outnumbered by their guest workers, display traditional Arab characteristics of a patriarchal society, a great love of hospitality, valuing of personal relationships and strong family ties. They are essentially traders at heart and are canny in business. They are, however, a minority and outside government-owned companies, almost every worker is an ex-pat. The government is trying now to prioritise jobs for Emiratis before the situation gets out of hand. </p>"

      "body": " <p>Formerly seven independent and internally self-governing states, the UAE were originally desert oases, each one ruled by a Bedouin shaikh, and settled in the 18th and early 19th centuries. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227336/pid-2080167-227336-704261607.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">In 1892, they became the Trucial States, giving Britain control of foreign and defence policies but remaining otherwise independent and self-governing. This arrangement lasted until the formation of the United Arab Emirates in 1971. The Emirates today include Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Qaiwain, al-Fujairah and Ras al-Khaimah. Occupying some 87% of the overall territory, Abu Dhabi is by far the largest member in area, whereas Dubai is traditionally largest in population. Ajman is the smallest in both area and population, being basically an enclave of Sharjah, albeit with its own coastline. </p> <p>Abu Dhabi is the national capital and major centre for the oil and gas industry. Dubai is the commercial and shipping hub of the country. Dubai has built on its trading foundation to create the region's premier port and airport facilities, warehousing, tourism, ICT and financial infrastructure. </p> <p>Sharjah is the third most important emirate and the centre for manufacturing. Similar to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, it has an entrepreneurial business culture. </p> <p>Some 80% of residents are expatriates, from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, other Arabic countries, Philippines, Iran, East European countries and Western Europe. West Europeans form a wealthy minority and mostly work in the multinational companies. Most of the population is urban-dwelling and lives on the coast, although there are still some Bedouin living in the desert.</p> <p>Although the UAE regards itself as a melting pot, people do live in fairly segregated communities. Low-paid workers live on bleak workers' compounds and tend to stick with their own ethnic group. Executive expatriates live in villas with pools and also move in their own circles, sending their children to private school and flying home in July and August, when the heat and humidity are intolerable. Everybody drives (it's too hot to walk and the public transport system is used mainly by the lower-paid workers). Social life revolves around private clubs, the luxury beach clubs and the scene in the big four and five star hotels, which sell alcohol (in Dubai). Wealth is on display everywhere and the executive class regards itself as well-off. </p> <p>Since a watershed 2003 decision to open unrestricted freehold ownership to foreigners, wealthy Europeans and Asians have rushed to become part of the Dubai property boom. A beachfront in one of the \"Palms\" - artificial islands being created in the sea - or, better yet, a private island in \"The World\" (another cluster of islands shaped like the world map) now has the cachet of St. Tropez or Grand Cayman.</p>"

In the wealthy UAE, world-class golf, fast cars, power boating and any other motorised watersport should be added to this. The reality, though, is that Dubai and Abu Dhabi (Dubai in particular) offer far more. Just about every leisure interest under the sun is catered for, including skiing, at the new Ski Dubai indoor slope. In addition, ballooning, tennis, ice skating, riding, running, squash, gym and kite surfing are all popular. </p> <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227336/pid-2080173-227336-704261607.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">Football is one of the most popular sports in the UAE. Games between local teams can be enjoyed throughout the season at Al Wahda football stadium..One of the highlights of the year is the Rugby Sevens held in Dubai. </p> <p>The most popular pursuit, however, has to be shopping. Dubai has some of the world's biggest malls, accommodating every designer imaginable, and there is an annual shopping festival during which excess and consumerism are celebrated.</p> <p>For expatriates, there are numerous clubs and societies, which form the basis of a social life for many. A lot of people also belong to private beach clubs, several of which have restaurants, pools and spas, and many families own a boat. </p> <p>A popular activity is camping excursions into the desert, and wadi-bashing (driving four wheel drives up and down dunes and along dried-up river beds).</p> <p>Eating out is also popular, and a lot of the social scene for expatriates and rich locals revolves around hotels, which are licensed to sell alcohol (except in Sharjah, which is dry). Ex-pats can also obtain a licence to drink alcohol at home. Both Dubai and Abu Dhabi have a huge range of restaurants, serving cuisine from all over the world. All the usual fast-food establishments are also present.</p> <p>Everything in Dubai seems to be geared to being a record breaker, including the world's tallest building, the world's first underwater hotel, the world's only seven-star hotel, the world's largest shopping mall and so on. While the traditional wooden dhow sailing boats still ply the Creek (the waterway which bisects the city) and visitors still haggle for gold in the souks, there is a certain sense that the new, the artificial and the grandiose are the way forward. Abu Dhabi is slightly more traditional, while the remaining five emirates offer a taste of life as it used to be.</p>"

Accept and extend invitations and learn about Emirati etiquette before visiting someone's office or home. It is impolite to reject coffee or tea when offered. </li><li>Remember that you will be dealing with people from many different cultures. Learn something about Indian and Pakistani cultural values in particular to help you better understand your colleagues in the UAE. Remember, too, that not all Arabs working in the UAE are Gulf Arabs; many come from much more conservative cultures and will have different values to the local community. </li><li>Recognise that honour or saving face is exceptionally important in any negotiation or business transaction. Be prepared to be indirect when saying no or declining an offer. Maintaining a sense of harmony will require a high degree of diplomacy and great patience, and you must do you best not to show frustration. </li><li>Remember that relationships are a key element in doing business. You will need to take your time to cultivate and maintain these relationships so do not be in a hurry or be pushy. Once a relationship is formed, it is for life and you can call upon it any time, as they can call on you. Having said this, price drives most business negotiations. </li><li>Watch your body language as Arabs are very perceptive of gestures and space. Maintain good eye contact at all times, expect people to come close to you and be very tactile. It is not unusual for your Emirati colleague (if they are an Arab) to hold your hand for a long time or sit closely to you (if you are a man). </li><li>Behave with sensitivity where alcohol is concerned. Dubai is pretty liberal and alcohol is available in Abu Dhabi in certain restaurants, but is harder to come by in the other Emirates. Sharjah is completely dry. </li><li>Steer clear of anything that could be construed as pornographic, all drugs, and all products connected with pork. </li><li>Negotiations may take a long time and require several visits. This is partly to build trust, and partly because decisions may be made elsewhere. Decisions are made at the top, by consensus, often with the help of various committees. In contrast, once a plan has been agreed on, your Emirati counterpart may expect swift action. Allow plenty of time for several rounds of negotiations per client and be prepared for delays. Do not plan your trip months in advance and always confirm appointments a few days ahead of your trip. </li><li>Since business is personal, remember that the spoken word or verbal communication is more important than written communication. You get better results and quicker responses by meeting people or calling them rather than writing to them. Minimise your reliance on faxes and e-mails for \"contractual\" issues. </li><li>Typically, most meetings in the Arab world are \"circular\" rather than \"linear\". This means that your Emirati counterpart will in most cases not stick to a fixed agenda in terms of order, re-visit points when you thought you had cleared them, and regularly raise personal issues, comments or observations in the middle of a business discussion. They do this for a variety of reasons including diffusing of tension when the tough gets going and giving everyone time and space to re-think their positions.</li></ol> </p><p></p>"

      "title": "Working with the Emiratis",
      "body": " <p>Business in the Arab world is always personal. The Arabs have been successful traders for centuries and to many, business is a way of life. The strength of tribalism with its emphasis on family solidarity, paternalistic leadership, and warm relationships strengthens the link between business and personal life. With a better understanding of this approach to business, you will be better equipped to handle meetings, understand tactics, avoid frustration and see opportunities.</p> <p>The \"Business is Personal\" perspective has many connotations, implications and indications. To start with, your Emirati counterpart would want to know you, trust you and feel comfortable with you on the personal level before anything productive begins to happen. This means investment in time on the personal level and from a corporate level, different selection criteria for positions in the Arab world. Typically, most Western organisations would send the expatriate for an average of three years posting, and in the Arab world, both the corporate and their expatriate will need to be prepared to stay much longer. </p> <p>For visiting expatriates and businessmen and women, long periods of absence is not a good idea. Regular visits will need to be scheduled, and if that is not possible, continuous telephone conversation is advisable. These telephone calls need not be business, and in fact, it will consolidate the relationship when people pick up the phone just to say \"Hello\", \"How are you\", and exchange news.</p> <p>Getting to know your Emirati counterpart is also an essential tool for networking in the UAE. More than anything else, being a friend of a friend, or having Waasta (connections) can cut considerable time and red tape. The Korean proverb \"for our friends we interpret the law and for our enemies we apply the law\" is just as true for most of the Arab world. When you are visiting your Emirati colleague and you are suddenly interrupted by a visiting friend or family member do not get frustrated, but rather use it as an opportunity to further expand your network.</p> <p>Expect transactions to take longer than you might be used to - unless your Emirati counterpart suddenly decides he wants to work with you and demands that things move ahead quickly, often on no more than a handshake.</p> <p>Bear in mind that your day-to-day dealings may be with an Indian or Pakistani, or Lebanese manager in an Emirati-owned company. While they will clearly have absorbed some of the corporate culture, they, too, are likely to be an expatriate with different cultural values of their own.</p>"

      "body": " <p>One of the most important golden rules in all cross-cultural interactions is that \"perception is reality\". This means that getting to know the Emirati perceptions of your culture or company or you is key to <img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227336/pid-2080176-227336-704261607.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">business success. The magic lies in \"consolidating\" or \"building on\" the positive perceptions and \"counteracting\" the negative perceptions. One example is that \"westerners and the Japanese\" are very punctual and time conscious and that is a respected characteristic, so make sure you are always on time, even if you know that your host will be late. It will always work to your advantage. On the other hand, the Arab perception of \"westerners\" is that they are \"rigid or impersonal\" and so showing your personal side will enhance your image.</p> <p>Emiratis, particularly in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, live in a multicultural society and are comfortable dealing with visiting businesspeople. Like other Arabs, Emiratis are hospitable and place a great deal of emphasis on an outward expression of politeness and quiet demeanour. Aggressive and demonstrative behaviour will not be well received and can rapidly diminish any chance of meaningful business engagement.</p> <p>Image is important and you should be smartly dressed. Men should always dress in Western style; it's illegal to wear a dish dasha (the long, white shift worn by Arab men). Women should dress respectfully at all times and cover up down to the knees and elbows. The exception to this is at the beach clubs, where designer swimwear is more appropriate. </p> <p>Pay attention to your company's branding. Prestige is important. Potential clients want to see what your status is within your home country. A good website with strong links to relevant industry partners or associations really helps. Tailor your business plan to the climate. It should include realistic budgets; comments and advice from seasoned practitioners; conservative timelines; and avoid open-ended commitments. </p> <p>Do not underestimate the importance of entertaining. Accept invitations graciously and learn social etiquette before attending. You are not obliged to reciprocate, although it's acceptable to do so if you wish.</p> <p>Understand the importance of forming a bond with your counterpart. Once the bond is established, they will see you as their friend. If you are visiting the UAE, you should drop in to visit them, even better if there is no business to conduct, issues for follow up or favours to be called upon. Keeping in touch is essential. </p>"

      "body": " <p>Have business cards printed in Arabic, with your full title and qualifications, but do not fall into the trap of translating or transliterating your foreign address which is meaningless. Your Arab counterpart <img alt=\"\" src=\"&lt;%=p.Ini.ImagePath%&gt;208/227336/pid-2080161-227336-704261607.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"1\">wants to build a picture of who you are, so give as much information as possible. How your title is translated will be critical in relaying that image. Titles such as \"coordinator\", \"representative\" can be meaningless in Arabic. It is a good idea to include \"Manager\" in your title. English should be printed on the reverse. If you are having only Arabic cards, embossed gold text impresses. When you translate your card, make sure that you choose a good translator and have them proofed by a reliable Arab friend.</p> <p>Expect to be addressed as \"Mr John\" or \"Miss Julia\" - this is standard practice in the United Arab Emirates, and your contacts will likely refer to each other as \"Mr Abdul\" and so forth.</p> <p>Brochures and other promotional literature should always be printed in Arabic, either with or without an English translation. </p> <p><strong>Body language</strong></p> <p>Arabs are very tactile. When engaged in conversation, they tend to stand much closer to one another than Americans, North Europeans and East Asians do. In other words, the Arab \"personal space\" is much smaller than most Europeans or North Americans, but may be slightly larger than the Indian Sub-continent. Arabs will also employ some body contact to emphasise a point or confirm that they have your attention, like touching your arm. It is important not to draw back. This may be interpreted as a rebuff or rejection of what is being said. Be sure to maintain steady eye contact, too, so that you appear trustworthy. Looking up while talking maybe interpreted as condescending, looking down as being subservient and looking away as being evasive.</p> <p>Arabs traditionally use the right hand for all public functions - including shaking hands, eating, drinking, and passing objects to another person. The left hand is considered unclean and you must minimise using it when coming into contact with another person. Gesticulating wildly may also be considered impolite. It is also rude to point the sole of the foot at the person to whom you are sitting next when sitting cross-legged, so be careful how you sit.</p> <p>You should avoid any display of anger or impatience. Learn to relax and not exhibit signs of tension, which may transmit uncertainty. Assume a calm demeanour, avoid brash conversation and maintain a body posture that is non-aggressive. Maintain eye contact with your host. Rapid shifts in eye contact may be construed as a lack of trust. </p> <p><strong>Gifts</strong></p> <p>It is difficult to choose a gift in the UAE because everything is already here, and cheaper than anywhere else in the world. There are a few basic rules, though. A gift will be opened and scrutinised in front of you and should be the best you can afford - a handmade carpet, for example. Never buy gold jewellery or silk garments for men, as both are deemed effeminate in Islam. Platinum is most acceptable but, as it can be confused with white gold, silver is safer, provided that it is properly hallmarked by a government authority [as opposed to merely bearing a maker's mark]. </p> <p>Traditional perfume is the gift most appreciated by Arab men Just as in Europe a man displays his status by his tailoring, so in Arabia he does so by his scent. The most generally preferred male scent is oud, a distillation of aloes wood, which can cost well over �1,000 an ounce. The same is true of incense, costing per kilogram roughly the same as an ounce of its extract. </p> <p>Avoid alcohol, perfume containing alcohol, anything made of pig products, knives, anything picturing a dog and anything that could be construed as pornographic. </p> <p><strong>Communication style</strong></p> <p>Arabs are high-context communicators which means that there is a much broader meaning to the actual words they use, and body language and the general mood must be taken into consideration. 'Yes', for example, can mean 'perhaps' or even just 'I hear you' depending on the body language that is accompanying it together with the tone in which it is said. Be aware that you will be judged in the same way, so watch your body language. </p> <p>Emiratis are highly verbal and do not place the same emphasis on written communications that Westerners do. A phone call will have more impact than a series of e-mails, but a personal visit will have the biggest impact of all. It is only in a face-to-face situation that you can absorb the full meaning of what is being said via gestures, tongue clicking, eye contact, eyebrow raising, facial expressions and nods or shakes of the head. Learn to become an active listener and when you speak, do so with brevity and confidence, maintaining emphasis on your paramount objectives.</p>"

Always be punctual; it is expected of you. The sense of flexibility is due to a variety of factors ranging from a call from a 'higher authority', family business or prayer times. </p> <p>If your host is unavailable, try to reschedule the meeting with a personal assistant. Personal assistants, however, may not have the power or discretion they have in the West. </p> <p>It can be useful to leave behind a brief (pre-prepared) note on company letterhead, regretting that you were disappointed to miss your contact. Outline your willingness to meet at an alternative time, along with your hotel and telephone details. This generally works.</p> <p>As visits may involve rescheduled meetings, it is important to operate flexibly. It is unrealistic to plan a two-day visit with five calls per day and presume your itinerary will run to time. Always allow an extra day. </p> <p><strong>During the meeting</strong></p> <p>Arab meeting settings in the UAE vary but it is best to be prepared. In many instances, you may be meeting with an expatriate executive and the meeting will follow standard international practice.</p> <p>There are many characteristics of Arab meetings in the UAE. Coffee should always be offered. Your host may interrupt the meeting at any time to answer any one of a number of phones, fixed and mobile, or respond to an assistant seeking a signature or advice. Others may interrupt the meeting, whether or not they are related to it. Accept this and greet them politely if introduced. Your host may even suspend the meeting to attend prayers. </p> <p>Be ready for long, often poetic speeches and expansive conversation. Don't get involved in political discussion and don't demonstrate impatience. Don't expect a 'normal' structure to the meeting - Arabs think in a circular, not linear fashion and do not follow agendas. Make sure you keep your three 'must win' points in play during the meeting. Do not get distracted from your objectives by what, in the Arab world, are standard meeting dynamics. </p> <p><strong>After the meeting</strong></p> <p>You must maintain the relationship once the meeting is over, with business entertaining and continued frequent contact. Make phone calls rather than sending emails. Keep written correspondence for contractual things only. If you are in the region again, drop in on your contact as a social call, whether or not you have business to discuss.</p>"

Contract workers are also paid an indemnity or end-of-service benefit at the end of the contract period, based on their basic salary. Bigger indemnities are paid for longer service, and termination of a contract early may mean losing the indemnity, or having to accept less. </p> <p>Arabs, however, are also motivated by a sense of belonging. They are family-orientated and risk-averse and will respond best to an environment where they feel valued and at home. This will encourage them to feel loyal to the company. Communication between managers and subordinates should be verbal wherever possible, not via memos. Feedback should be spontaneous, positive and encouraging and anything negative should be conveyed indirectly and discreetly.</p> <p>Emiratis are also motivated by prestige. A job with a multinational is considered prestigious, or a very high-ranking position in an Emirati company. Nepotism is prevalent, despite the more transparent culture, and promotion within a company may be a fairly subjective matter. </p> <p>Setting targets and deadlines will not motivate Arabs, whose concept of time is completely different to that of, say, an American. People other than those at the top rarely put in overtime, allowing work to encroach on family time, and certainly not to meet some arbitrary deadline set by a guest worker.

Positive feedback is acceptable if it's spontaneous and distributed between a whole team. Negative feedback must be delivered tactfully, indirectly and in private. Remember that prestige and a sense of belonging are strong motivators to Arabs.</p> <p>Harmony in the workplace should always be encouraged; although a heated discussion in Arabic may sound like an argument, it is merely an exchange of views. Losing one's cool does not impress and causes a loss of face for all concerned. Any workplace is going to include a team from many different cultures, and many companies have a strict policy of tolerance and diversity, which should always be acknowledged.</p>"
